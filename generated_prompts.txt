# Abstract

A renal biopsy is an important tool in the evaluation of a patient with medical kidney disease. There is extensive overlap of clinical manifestations of a variety of kidney diseases, and the pathologic examination of tissues using light microscopy, immunoﬂuorescence microscopy, and electron microscopy enables a renal pathologist to render an accurate diagnosis. Unfortunately, the host response to a variety of injurious agents also shows signiﬁcant morphologic overlap. Hence, the renal biopsy interpretation should not be performed in a clinical vacuum and the value of timely communication with the nephrologist can never be underestimated. A thorough and systematic evaluation of various compartments, that is, glomeruli, tubules, interstitium, and blood vessels, points to the primary site of injury.

The glomerular diseases are traditionally classiﬁed based on the presenting clinical syndrome, laboratory investigations, and morphologic pattern. Over the last two decades, many scientiﬁc advances have helped us gain insights into the relevant pathophysiological mechanisms, and these etiologic factors are being increasingly utilized in the classiﬁcation of diseases. Better understanding of speciﬁc diseases such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous glomerulonephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, immunoglobulin (Ig)G4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis, and autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease can aid in identifying more speciﬁc therapeutic targets.

An allograft biopsy is the gold standard for assessment of graft dysfunction and institution of appropriate therapy. In addition to rejection, infections and drug toxicities can be diagnosed on biopsy and the extent of irreversible chronic changes can be estimated. Better laboratory tools and morphologic assessment methods have helped characterize the diagnostic and prognostic features of antibody-mediated rejection.

Renal biopsy is an important tool used in the evaluation of patients with renal disease.1–3 Utilizing this procedure, it is possible to establish an accurate diagnosis, obtain critical information on the evolution and prognosis of the disease process, and develop a rational approach to the treatment of a renal disorder.4–6 Even in advanced stages of kidney damage, a biopsy can provide clues regarding the possibility of recurrence of the disease following transplantation. The renal biopsy is also important in the management of the transplant recipient, representing the most accurate method for determining the presence of antibody- or T cell–mediated rejection, acute tubular injury, calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity, or the development of de novo or recurrent glomerulonephritis in the allograft.

Renal disease is usually manifested by a limited number of symptoms that are commonly grouped in clinical syndromes, that is, nephrotic syndrome, persistent proteinuria, acute nephritic syndrome, persistent or recurrent hematuria, asymptomatic renal insufficiency, hypertension, rapidly progressive renal failure, acute renal failure, and chronic renal failure. Given the fact that the kidney reacts to a variety of injurious agents with a limited number of histopathologic patterns of injury, a given clinical syndrome can be associated with several histopathologic patterns, while a single histopathologic pattern may be linked to more than one syndrome. The accurate interpretation of a renal biopsy requires detailed knowledge of the structure and function of the normal kidney, as well as an understanding of the clinical, morphologic, and histopathogenic aspects of renal disease. To evaluate a kidney biopsy, the pathologist should correlate the clinical and laboratory information with light microscopic, immunofluorescence, and ultrastructural findings.

# Handling of the Biopsy

Most renal biopsies are done by either the percutaneous route using a cutting needle or by direct exposure of the kidney (open biopsy, often a wedge sampling of outer cortex). Most centers use 16–18-gauge needles for adults and 18-gauge needles for children less than 8 years of age. The specimen should be divided for light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. Ideally, two biopsy cores should be obtained when a needle biopsy is performed. From the first core, two or more samples measuring 0.5–1 mm in thickness are taken from each end with a fresh razor or scalpel blade and placed in a cold solution of 2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate or cacodylate buffer for electron microscopy studies while the remaining tissue is placed in saline. If the second core is adequate, samples should also be taken from each end for electron microscopy, while the remainder is snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or in isopentane cooled on dry ice for immunofluorescence. For light microscopy, the tissue that was placed in saline should be transferred to a fixative, most common being 10% buffered formalin. If only one core is obtained, material should be taken from each end for electron microscopy and the remainder divided for light microscopy and immunofluorescence. If the core is too small, the specimen should be divided for electron microscopy and immunofluorescence studies since most of the light microscopic information can be obtained from the study of semi-thin sections of the plastic-embedded tissue processed for electron microscopy. Longitudinal division of the cores should be avoided. The triaging of the biopsy sample should ideally ensure that all three portions include cortex. On gross examination of the cores under dissecting microscope or loupe (magnifying device), glomeruli in well-preserved cortex appear as pale or congested bulges; however, this may not be evident when cores with sclerotic glomeruli or fibrotic interstium are examined.

# Light Microscopy

A variety of fixatives have been recommended for the light microscopic study of renal biopsies. Zenker, Helly, Bouin, and Van der Griff fixatives are sometimes used and many pathologists feel that mercuric solutions provide the best architectural and cytologic detail. However, 10% neutral formalin can also provide good morphologic detail while also preserving the sample for future immunohistochemical studies or immunofluorescence microscopy on paraffin-embedded tissues, if needed.7,8 To evaluate for glycogen or crystals of urate, uric acid, and other water-soluble substances, tissue should be fixed in ethanol. A panel of hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x26;E), periodic acid–Schiff (PAS), methenamine silver, and trichrome stains are recommended for the routine evaluation of renal biopsies, but from the practical point of view, PAS is the most useful, is easiest to perform, and can also provide most of the information obtained from other stains. It is recommended that the biopsy core be serially sectioned (2–3 μm thick) and that three to four tissue sections be placed on each slide. At regular intervals, one slide is stained with H&#x26;E, one with PAS, one with trichrome, and another with silver stain. By following this procedure, the maximum number of glomeruli can be examined. The remaining unstained slides are saved in case special stains or immunohistochemical stains are needed.

# Electron Microscopy

There is a general misconception that electron microscopy is a complex and time-consuming procedure. In fact, satisfactory processing methods have been developed that require less than 5 hours.9 Many fixatives have been developed for this procedure, each of which has specific advantages. Some pathologists prefer a primary fixation in osmium tetroxide for the optimal demonstration of deposits and basement membrane structure, but glutaraldehyde fixation with post-osmification is more convenient and is suitable as a routine procedure. For tissue embedding, various epoxy resins with comparable characteristics are available and their selection is a matter of personal preference. Semi-thin (1 μm thick) sections obtained from the plastic-embedded tissue blocks are stained with toluidine blue or methylene blue and carefully studied as they can yield a great deal of information, especially when examined at high magnification (Fig. 23.1).10 Thin sections from the blocks selected for ultrastructural study are double-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for electron microscopic examination.

# Immunofluorescence Microscopy

Direct immunofluorescence performed on frozen sections is the simpler, faster, and most satisfactory method for the routine evaluation of a renal biopsy, but indirect methods may be used for extra sensitivity or for a specific antibody. The portion of the biopsy specimen selected for immunofluorescence is oriented in standard frozen section embedding compound on a piece of cork and is snap frozen by immersion in a beaker containing either isopentane or methyl-butane surrounded by liquid nitrogen or dry ice. Frozen sections of 2–4 μm thick are cut and stained with specific antibodies and examined under ultraviolet light using either transmitted or incident illumination, and the reactions are graded subjectively using a scale of 0 to 3 + (or 4 +, depending on individual labs) and recorded by photography. The antibodies that are most commonly used are those against immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, IgM, kappa and lambda light chains, C1q, C3, C4, and fibrinogen or fibrin. Immunostaining for a variety of other antigens can also be performed for selective diagnostic purposes. For example, C4d is very useful for the diagnosis of antibody-mediated acute allograft rejection.11,12

membranous glomerulonephritis [MGN]), the identification of specific features in a single glomerulus may be sufficient, especially if ultrastructural studies are also performed. While there is often a variation in the severity of a specific lesion among different glomeruli, even in diffuse processes, a good guideline to follow is that at least 5–10 glomeruli should be examined to properly assess the extent of the disease.

# Normal Structure of the Glomerulus

Since most of the changes seen in renal biopsies occur in the glomerulus, we will briefly review the morphology of this structure. The glomerulus is a vascular structure composed of a tuft of specialized capillaries that arise from the afferent arteriole to form lobules, then rejoin the vascular pole to drain into the efferent arteriole. Normally, the lobules are poorly defined, but they are highlighted in some disease processes. Each lobule consists of a cluster of capillaries supported by the mesangium, which forms the centrolobular or axial framework of the glomerular tuft. The tuft of capillaries lies within the lumen of the expanded proximal end of the nephron, or Bowman space, which is lined on its parietal aspect by a layer of attenuated epithelial cells overlying a thick basement membrane. Together, the latter two structures make up the Bowman capsule, which is continuous at the vascular pole of the glomerulus with the adventitia of the afferent and efferent arterioles. At the urinary pole, the basement membrane of the Bowman capsule merges with that of the proximal tubule. Each glomerulus measures approximately 200 μm in diameter, but they are all not of the same size. Those located in the juxtamedullary area are about 20% larger than those elsewhere in the cortex. The cellularity of the glomerulus varies in different diseases, and an accurate assessment requires histologic preparations of 2–4 μm thickness. The presence of more than three cells in an individual glomerular mesangial region away from the vascular pole is considered hypercellularity.

The walls of the glomerular capillaries are clothed by a reflected layer of cells of the Bowman capsule. These highly specialized epithelial cells are known as podocytes (visceral epithelial cells) because they have numerous tiny foot processes that rest on the basement membrane that separates them from the attenuated, fenestrated endothelium of the capillaries. The GBM is a trilaminar structure composed of a central electron-dense zone, or lamina densa, bordered by two narrow electron-lucent layers: the lamina rara interna and the lamina rara externa. The major components of the GBM are type IV collagen, laminin, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and entactin, but minor amounts of other proteins have also been found. The principal function of the glomerulus is filtration, and the GBM is the main component of the filtration barrier. In normal adults, the GBM measures 310–380 nm in thickness; it is somewhat thinner in children (and achieving adult thickness by 10–12 years age), and slightly thicker in males than in females. The GBM does not completely surround the capillary lumen since the vessel is attached to the mesangium, which consists of mesangial cells embedded in a basement membrane–like material, the mesangial matrix. By electron microscopy, the mesangial matrix appears more fibrillar than the GBM. It is composed of collagen types IV, V, and VI, fibronectin, laminin, entactin, and sulfated glycosaminoglycans, including heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. The mesangial cells have cytoplasmic processes that contain α-smooth muscle actin, α-actinin, and myosin filaments, characteristics shared by smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and myofibroblasts. Mesangial cells thus possess contractile properties and are probably involved in the regulation of blood flow through the glomeruli and modulation of the filtration process. They produce growth factors that allow normal cell turnover. Mesangial cells may also have some phagocytic.

# Biopsy Interpretation

Although potentially challenging, the diagnosis of renal biopsy specimens is based on the same foundation of careful observation and clinicopathologic correlation that is used in other areas of pathology. A knowledge of normal morphology is essential for the recognition of any alteration that may occur in the various components of the kidney. Obtaining adequate clinical history is crucial to any renal biopsy interpretation. A checklist that can be used during the biopsy evaluation is provided in Table 23.1.

A renal biopsy must contain glomeruli to be considered adequate, but there is disagreement over the number of glomeruli required to make a diagnosis. The definition of adequacy largely depends on the disease under consideration. In disorders characterized by irregular or crescentic proliferation, the assessment should be based on a minimum of 10 glomeruli, whereas, in diffuse lesions (such as ...

activity and play a role in the clearance of debris, including immune deposits from the mesangium. Although obvious ultrastructural differences exist between the endothelial and mesangial cells, these differences are not always evident in glomerular diseases, and the distinction between the endothelium and the mesangium is usually based on the location of these structures in the glomerulus.

The visceral epithelial cells/podocytes are involved in basement membrane synthesis and, by their unique structure, play an important role in glomerular permeability. These cells cover the GBM on its urinary side and are attached to it by cytoplasmic extensions or foot processes that, under the scanning electron microscope, appear as a complex of interdigitating structures originating from different epithelial cells (Fig. 23.3). The foot processes are approximately 25–60 nm apart, with a connecting slit-pore diaphragm 4–7 nm thick that shows similarities with tight and adherens junctions. Several molecules identified in podocyte foot processes and slit diaphragms over the last two decades contribute to the structural integrity and permselectivity of the filtration barrier. Bowman capsule limits the urinary space and is lined by a layer of flattened parietal epithelial cells that express cytokeratin proteins. In contrast, the visceral epithelial cells do not immunoreact for cytokeratin but do for vimentin and desmin. Recent evidence suggests that parietal epithelial stem.

# Glomerular Lesions Associated With the Nephrotic Syndrome

The nephrotic syndrome is clinically characterized by the occurrence of massive proteinuria, hypoproteinemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia. Damage to the filtration barrier of the glomerulus allows proteins, particularly albumin, to be filtered into the urine. The criterion for the syndrome is the excretion of more than 3.5 g of protein in a 24-hour period. A spectrum of morphology has been correlated with the syndrome, but some glomerular lesions are not accompanied by significant inflammatory or proliferative response within the glomerulus, including primary nephrotic syndrome with minimal change disease (MCD), MGN, diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, and various forms of congenital nephrotic syndrome. The major histologic, electron microscopic, and immunofluorescence findings in each of these conditions are summarized in Table 23.2.

# Minimal Change Disease

MCD (also known as nil lesion, and minimal change nephrotic syndrome) is the most common cause of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children, accounting for 80%–90% of all cases of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in childhood, and 10%–15% of adult cases. Most of the affected children are under the age of 6 years at initial diagnosis, the majority being 3 or 4 years old. There appears to be a male predominance, especially in children, where the male to female ratio is 2 to 3 : 1. MCD is more common among whites, Asians, and Hispanics than blacks. While MCD is idiopathic in 80%–90% of children, in a minority of cases it has been associated with viral infections, recent immunizations, ingestion of heavy metals (e.g., mercury or lead), allergies to some foods, dust, bee stings, and poison ivy, and drug reactions to a variety of agents, including lithium, interferon, and pamidronate. While the exact mechanism of MCD development is unclear, the final common event likely involves podocyte injury. In adult patients, especially the elderly, MCD can manifest as a hypersensitivity reaction to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In these cases, the disease is often accompanied by renal insufficiency and the development of acute interstitial nephritis. In most of these patients, cessation of the offensive medication results in resolution of the proteinuria. MCD has also been reported in association with lymphoid malignancies, usually Hodgkin lymphoma. Remission of the nephrotic syndrome has been obtained in these cases with the cure of the lymphoma. Other neoplastic diseases that might cause MCD include leukemias, carcinomas, and thymomas, among others. MCD is a now well-defined renal manifestation of lupus nephritis or may be seen in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. De novo MCD has been reported in patients with post-transplant nephrotic syndrome. None of the recipients had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) as a primary disease. The pathogenesis of idiopathic MCD remains unknown, but it has been suggested that a circulating factor/s produced by T lymphocytes that damage one or more elements of the glomerular permeability barrier is responsible for the proteinuria seen in this condition. Patients with MCD do show T-cell subset abnormalities, and elevated levels of interleukin-13 (IL-13) were demonstrated during relapses. IL-13 has been shown to increase the expression of CD80 in podocytes. CD80, in turn, has been identified in the urine of patients of MCD and appears to be a potential diagnostic biomarker. Various injurious stimuli appear to activate the podocyte enzymatic pathways, resulting in disruption of actin cytoskeleton and slit diaphragm. In addition to structural disruption of the permeability barrier, the loss of podocyte negatively charged glycocalyx may contribute to the selective leakage of anionic plasma proteins such as albumin.

# Classification of Glomerular Disease

Glomerulonephritis is a term denoting an inflammation of the glomerulus, while glomerulopathy is an all-embracing term for disorders affecting this structure. In glomerular diseases, other parts of the nephron may also be involved, but the diagnosis hinges on the identification of a derangement of the normal glomerular configuration. While the changes may be recognizable by routine light microscopy, the findings from immunofluorescence are often significant. Electron microscopy is always informative and is sometimes the only means whereby the structural changes can be detected and defined. The damage to the glomeruli may take the form of definable morphologic patterns, and subdivisions in the character or distribution of the glomerular lesions are used to classify glomerulonephritis. Although there is general agreement on the definitions applied to the distribution of glomerular lesions, more specific categorizations are sometimes controversial.

MCD typically presents with heavy proteinuria, often of selective type, leading to the nephrotic syndrome. Microscopic hematuria is seen in less than 15% of patients, but macroscopic hematuria is rare. Blood pressure is usually normal at onset, and less than 20% of patients have hypertension. Given the high probability that nephrotic syndrome in a child is due to MCD, pediatric patients are treated empirically with steroids and do not undergo a renal biopsy unless the nephrotic syndrome is steroid resistant. Complete remission is common within 8 weeks of starting corticosteroid therapy. After withdrawal of the steroids, however, about half of the patients have intermittent relapses, a phase which may last for up to 10 years. The relapses are usually steroid responsive and the disease does not progress to chronic renal failure. Patients who achieve only partial remission with corticosteroid therapy may benefit from immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine. Newer agents such as anti-CD20 and anti-CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) antibodies are being tested in such patients. The biopsies from adult or elderly patients may show different characteristics.

Figure 23.4 Glomerulus From a Patient With Minimal Change Disease.

Figure 23.5 Portion of a glomerulus from a patient with minimal change disease showing obliteration of foot processes. The visceral epithelial cell cytoplasm shows microvillus and cyst formation (×8400).

The glomerulus is normocellular, the capillary loops are patent, and the basement membrane is normal in thickness. The glomeruli may not be entirely normal on light microscopy and can show a variety of preexisting pathologies such as age-related glomerulosclerosis, hypertensive arteriosclerosis, chronic tubulointerstitial damage, or mild diabetic nephropathy.

The characteristic ultrastructural appearance of the glomeruli is of total foot process effacement with the basement membrane being covered by sheets of cytoplasm. Loss of the visceral epithelial processes is accompanied by distortion of the filtration slits, with a decrease in the number of slit diaphragms.⁴⁷ Visceral epithelial cells/podocytes show prominent intracytoplasmic organelles, suggesting increased cytoplasmic activity, and frequently contain cystoplasmic cysts/vacuoles. Numerous microvilli (i.e., villous projections of podocyte cytoplasm into urinary space) are often seen in MCD (Fig. 23.5). There is a frequent increase in the density of the cytoskeleton, especially actin filaments, in the cytoplasm adjacent to the basement membrane, but no electron-dense deposits are present. Lower degrees of podocyte foot process effacement may be observed in MCD patients with partial response to therapy.

Figure 23.6 Immunofluorescence preparation demonstrating numerous albumin-positive resorption droplets in the proximal tubular epithelial cells.

Immunofluorescence studies are almost invariably negative for immunoglobulin and complement, but small amounts of IgM and C3 can occasionally be seen in cases with mesangial prominence. Albumin can be demonstrated as fine droplets in the cytoplasm of the proximal tubule cells when the tissue is stained for this protein (Fig. 23.6).

Five histologic subtypes have been described, including collapsing variant, “tip” lesion, cellular variant, perihilar lesion, and FSGS-NOS (not otherwise specified) variant.50,51 This histologic classification is hierarchical and is referred to as “Columbia classification of FSGS.”

Because a biopsy is susceptible to sampling error, it should be kept in mind that lesions that affect only some glomeruli, such as FSGS, can lead to a misdiagnosis of MCD. Conversely, since tubular atrophy (TA) and interstitial scarring are not features of MCD, a diagnosis of FSGS should be considered if these findings are seen on a biopsy, especially in a child. It has been recently proposed that reduced expression of dystroglycan and CD44 observed in MCD can help differentiate it from FSGS, but further confirmation is needed.48,49

# Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis

FSGS, as a disease entity, is a clinicopathologic syndrome characterized by proteinuria, commonly in the nephrotic range, a high incidence of progressive renal failure, and focal and segmental sclerotic glomerular lesions. The segmental sclerosis results from an increase in mesangial matrix, causing obliteration of the glomerular capillaries. From an etiologic standpoint, FSGS may be primary or secondary to various forms of injuries or pathogenic mechanisms. The morphologic variants of FSGS are not helpful in distinguishing primary.

Rewrite the following pathology text into a more formal and comprehensive paragraph suitable for a pathology report. STATEMENT: Glomerular Lesions Associated With the Nephrotic Syndrome
from secondary FSGS and a biopsy diagnosis of FSGS should prompt an evaluation of etiology. The pathogenesis of primary FSGS is unknown, but it appears to be the result of circulating “permeability” factor(s), possibly a lymphokine or a cytokine, which leads to epithelial cell injury resulting in segmental scar and ultimately glomerular obsolescence. 55 The potential circulating permeability factors include cardiotrophin-like cytokine 1 and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, but they have not been shown to be entirely sensitive or specific. 52,56

FSGS can be secondary to a variety of conditions including drugs, viral infections, healed glomerulonephritis, and structural adaptive responses. In addition, genetic associations with either autosomal dominant or recessive mode of inheritances are being increasingly recognized as a cause of FSGS. 52,57,58 Mutations have been detected in several podocyte genes encoding proteins in the slit diaphragm, cytoskeleton, mitochondria, transcription, and DNA repair. Several patients with FSGS who would have been previously categorized as a “idiopathic” FSGS might in fact have a genetic form of FSGS. 52,59 Even in cases without a single gene mutation, there appears to be a familial susceptibility to developing FSGS. Recent studies have established a strong association between apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene and FSGS in blacks. 60,61 The risk alleles G1 and G2 are more commonly seen in blacks and are also linked to higher rates of progressive kidney disease. The APOL1 gene product is expressed in podocytes and platelets and although the exact mechanism of kidney disease causation is unknown, the risk alleles appear to confer an evolutionary protection against Trypanosoma brucei infections.60

The glomerular lesion of secondary FSGS can be histologically identical to that seen in primary FSGS and can occur in a variety of clinical settings with a clinical presentation indistinguishable from that of primary FSGS. Since the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in these disorders and their treatment differs significantly from that of primary FSGS, it is of paramount importance that they be excluded before a diagnosis of primary FSGS is made. 62–64 In Box 23.2 are listed the conditions most commonly associated with FSGS which should be excluded before making the diagnosis of primary FSGS.

Primary FSGS is responsible for approximately 10%–15% of the cases of nephrotic syndrome in children and 20%–30% in adults. It constitutes the predominant cause of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in adult patients, especially in blacks.65 Nephrotic range proteinuria is common and the clinical manifestation can be an abrupt onset of nephrotic syndrome or insidious onset of subnephrotic proteinuria. Examination of the urinary sediment will often lead to the detection of microscopic hematuria. Forty to 60% of patients have been shown to develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10–20 years, 66,67 and recurrence following transplantation has been reported in 30%–40% of patients, often within weeks, leading to graft loss.68–72 The response to steroid therapy is limited, often prompting a second line of aggressive immunosuppressive therapy and plasmapheresis that aids the removal of the circulating permeability factor.

Pathologically, in primary or secondary FSGS, the segmental sclerosis, collapse, or obliteration of capillary lumen (i.e., depending on the morphologic variants) usually affects one or more lobules of the glomerular tuft. Early lesions may show an increased mesangial matrix and mild mesangial hypercellularity; only when the sclerosis is advanced do these areas become hypocellular, often with adhesions to the Bowman capsule (Fig. 23.7). The visceral epithelial cells can line the sclerotic segments and these adhesions, and hence the term “podocyte capping.” The loops in the sclerosed areas are distorted, and they may contain hyaline material (hyalinosis), which is thought to represent plasmatic insudation, and lipid-laden “foam” cells.73

These findings in the absence of collapsing, cellular and tip variant features (described later) and present in a nonperihilar distribution define a FSGS-NOS subtype.50,58

Figure 23.8 Tip variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis shows Bowman capsular adhesion and hyaline insudation at the tubular pole.

The adjacent podocytes also show hypertrophy with cytoplasmic protein droplets (PAS).

Figure 23.9 Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrating segmental deposition of IgM in a biopsy from a patient with focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (anti-IgM).

On occasion, sclerosis or consolidation is seen in the portion of the glomerulus opposite the hilus forming an adhesion in the vicinity of the opening of the Bowman space into the proximal tubule (glomerular tip lesion). The consolidated portion of the capillary tuft in “tip” lesion may display endothelial swelling and entrapped foam cells. The visceral epithelial cells overlying the involved segment are enlarged and vacuolated and often contain intracytoplasmic hyaline droplets. Some lesions are less cellular with an increase in mesangial matrix. The sclerotic segments in “perihilar” variant are localized next to the vascular pole, and it is a typical finding in secondary forms of FSGS attributable to adaptive functional response. The most controversial and least common subtype is the “cellular” variant in which the segmental lesion demonstrates intracapillary hypercellularity, and sometimes foam cells and karyorrhexis; hyperplasia of overlying podocytes is quite common. The collapsing FSGS lesion is described in detail in the subsequent section.

# Collapsing Glomerulopathy

Collapsing glomerulopathy is a clinically and pathologically distinct variant of FSGS that is characterized by the widespread collapse of glomerular capillary loops, and predominance in blacks attributable to the APOL1 risk alleles. Patients usually present with abrupt onset of nephrotic syndrome or nephrotic range proteinuria and renal impairment. An idiopathic form of collapsing FSGS has poor prognosis with rapid loss of renal function and virtually no response to immunosuppressive therapy. A circulating permeability factor might be responsible as evidenced by a rapid recurrence in an allograft. Collapsing FSGS can be a secondary process associated with intravenous (IV) drug abuse and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This variant of FSGS constitutes about 80%–85% of the glomerular changes reported in HIV-infected patients. Collapsing glomerulopathy has also been reported in association with some autoimmune diseases, lymphoproliferative disorders, drugs such as bisphosphonates and interferons, severe allograft ischemia, and non-HIV viral infections, such as hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus, and parvovirus B19. Treatment of the underlying cause is helpful in inducing remission in these secondary forms.

As FSGS represents podocyte injury, the most significant ultra structural feature to be evaluated is podocyte foot process effacement, especially in capillary loops (and glomeruli) unaffected by sclerosis. Extensive podocyte foot process effacement is a feature of primary FSGS and is often seen in collapsing, tip, and cellular FSGS subtypes. Some secondary forms of FSGS and perihilar morphologic variants typically have less degree of foot process effacement. A variable increase in mesangial matrix is customary in all glomeruli, and some degree of mesangial hypercellularity is not uncommon. In sclerosed segments, the GBMs are often folded and focally thickened; on occasion, foci of podocyte cell membrane detachment from GBM are seen and intervening space can accumulate multilayered basement membrane–like material and cellular debris. The hyaline deposits are composed of finely granular material that has a similar appearance to that of the insudative material seen in diabetic nephropathy. These insudations are predominantly subendothelial and located in the areas of segmental sclerosis; immunofluorescence studies show that they contain IgM and C3, but no immunoglobulin or complement deposition is seen in unaffected glomeruli.

# C1q Nephropathy

C1q nephropathy is a relatively uncommon and controversial immune complex–mediated glomerulopathy that is characterized by the presence of dominant or codominant C1q deposition in the mesangium. Patients may present with nephrotic syndrome or mild proteinuria with or without hematuria. The condition typically affects adolescents and young adults and appears to be more common in blacks than in whites. C1q nephropathy with normal histology or mesangial proliferation responds to corticosteroids, but FSGS histology is associated with poorer outcome. Progression to renal failure is slow, and it has been estimated that the 5-year renal survival rate is about 78%. It is not entirely clear as to whether C1q nephropathy is a specific clinical entity or is part of the clinico-pathologic spectrum of MCD and FSGS.

Light microscopic findings vary from slight to marked mesangial hypercellularity with an increase in mesangial matrix, with or without segmental glomerulosclerosis. Electron microscopy studies invariably demonstrate mesangial immune complex deposits. Subendothelial or subepithelial deposits are uncommon. On immunofluorescence, C1q is often accompanied by IgG, IgM, and C3; IgA has been reported in about 60% of the cases. The main differential diagnosis of C1q nephropathy is lupus nephritis which can also have prominent C1q deposition in the mesangium together with immunoglobulins and C3. Clinical presentation, serologic evidence, extraglomerular deposits, and presence of tubuloreticular inclusions help differentiate between class II lupus nephritis and C1q nephropathy.

# Membranous Glomerulonephritis

MGN (a.k.a. membranous nephropathy) is a glomerular disease of diverse etiology characterized by subepithelial immune complex deposits and variable basement membrane thickening, without infiltration by inflammatory cells. MGN accounts for 20%–30% of all cases of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in adults and 1%–9% in children. In large majority of cases, this condition occurs in a primary (“idiopathic”) form, but the disease has been related to a wide variety of conditions (secondary) in approximately 20%–25% of adults and 80% of children with MGN. Over 85% of cases of secondary MGN are caused by infection, neoplasia, or SLE. The most common causes worldwide are malaria and schistosomiasis, while SLE, neoplasia, hepatitis B infection, and drugs are the most frequent in the United States. Rare familial cases of MGN, probably related to a genetically transmitted mechanism, have been reported.

The pathogenetic mechanism that leads to the immune complex localization in the subepithelial aspect of the GBM, especially in primary forms, is being increasingly understood. Two mechanisms presumed responsible for the development and localization of the deposits along the GBM are that of in situ immune complex formation in the subepithelial capillary wall or that of circulating immune complexes being deposited in that location. Experimental studies suggest that in most cases, the immune complexes are formed in situ by the binding of circulating antibodies with antigens that are normally present in the glomerulus or with extrinsic antigens that have previously been planted as free antigens in the subepithelial area.¹⁰⁹

90% of the patients are over the age of 30 at the time of diagnosis, with a peak incidence in the fourth and fifth decades.¹²⁴ The disease is twice as common in males. Sixty to 80% of patients have the nephrotic syndrome at onset, and others are usually referred for investigation of asymptomatic proteinuria or an abnormal urinalysis.¹²⁵ The proteinuria is usually nonselective, but a highly selective proteinuria is seen in about 20% of cases.¹²⁴ Macroscopic hematuria is rare, but as many as 90% of patients have microscopic hematuria at some time during the course of the disease.¹²⁴,¹²⁶ Hypertension is usually found after renal insufficiency has developed, but it can be seen in 30% of the patients at presentation.¹⁰⁷ Rare cases with circulating anti-GBM antibody and/or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) have also been reported.¹²⁵ Serum levels of C3, as well as other components of complement, are normal; however, if reduced, this suggests a secondary form of the disease.

Primary human MGN appears to be largely an autoimmune disease with in situ glomerular immune complex formation. Over 70%–80% of primary MGN patients have autoantibodies directed against PLA 2R expressed in podocytes and proximal tubules.¹¹⁰,¹¹¹ These circulating PLA2R autoantibodies are IgG4 subtype and the plasma levels correlate with disease activity and therapeutic response,¹¹² and may predict the risk of post-transplantation recurrence.¹¹³ Removal of the etiologic agent will often result in the disappearance of the clinical symptoms and resolution of the renal lesion. The nephrotic syndrome may abate and the glomerular changes regress after resection and treatment of a malignant tumor. In patients with membranous lupus nephritis, the course is indolent, whereas those who develop a superimposed anti-GBM antibody disease undergo a rapid progression to renal failure. Most patients with primary MGN present with chronic proteinuria and have recurrent episodes of nephrotic syndrome persisting over many years. Only 20%–25% of these patients progress to renal failure terminating in ESRD.¹²⁷

Partial or complete spontaneous remission has been reported in 20%–65% of cases.¹²⁷,¹²⁸ The likelihood of spontaneous remission is greatly increased in children¹⁰⁶ and in patients who presented with proteinuria without the nephrotic syndrome and in whom the biopsy demonstrated a stage I glomerular lesion.¹²⁹ Recurrence or de novo development of MGN after renal transplantation can occur. The recurrence rates have ranged from 10% to 30% in different series, while the de novo rate is more common, accounting for about twice as many cases of MGN in transplant recipients.¹³⁰

Conditions associated with secondary MGN include chronic infections, neoplasms, autoimmune diseases (SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, IgG4-related systemic disease), drugs, and sarcoidosis. Drugs commonly associated with MGN include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, penicillamine, gold, lithium, mercury, captopril, and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. In some instances of secondary MGN, hepatitis B antigens (HBsAg, HBcAg, and HBeAg), virus-like particles (hepatitis C), tumor antigens, thyroglobulin, and DNA-containing material have been identified in the immune complexes, but it is unclear if these antigens are indeed pathogenic.¹¹⁹ Exogenous antigen such as cationic bovine serum albumin (BSA) derived from milk has been identified within subepithelial deposits in young children with MGN.¹²⁰ These children have no other evidence of milk allergy but have anti-BSA antibodies in circulation.

Secondary forms of MGN typically lack circulating PLA2R, but a small subset of patients with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, malignant neoplasm, and sarcoidosis have circulating serum PLA2R. While this may be coincidental, it also raises the possibility that “primary” MGN is triggered by an underlying disease. In both primary and secondary forms, complement is activated at the capillary wall site and appears to have a role in the development of the proteinuria.

The incidence of MGN in different populations varies; there is a particularly high frequency in Japanese children¹²¹ and in certain African populations,¹²²,¹²³ probably related to a high incidence of hepatitis B infection and parasitic infestations. Although MGN may occur at any age, it is rare in children and adolescents. Eighty to ninety percent of patients are over the age of 30 at the time of diagnosis.

Membranous Glomerulonephritis, Stage IV. The basement membrane is markedly irregular and most of the deposits have been reabsorbed, leaving large electron-lucent areas (×9360). Membranous bodies that are probably formed by degeneration of entrapped cellular components.

During the late stage of the disease (stage IV), deposits gradually lose their electron density and the basement membrane becomes vacuolated, folded, and thickened. Deposits may no longer be evident (Fig. 23.14). Capillary lumina become obliterated, and the glomerular tufts show segmental or global sclerosis. TA and vascular sclerosis can be prominent, making the diagnosis difficult. In the end-stage of the disease, the differential diagnosis includes various types of chronic glomerulonephritis. Although the degree of proteinuria does not parallel the stages of the renal lesion, stage I carries a better prognosis than more advanced disease and spontaneous remission is more likely. However, there seems to be no difference in prognosis between stages II, III, and IV. Histologic progression can occur without clinical progression, and clinical remission can occur in the absence of histologic regression.

Immunofluorescence microscopy in all stages of MGN reveals a generalized, peripheral granular pattern of IgG, C3, kappa and lambda, sometimes with IgM (Fig. 23.15). The reaction for IgA is usually absent, and if it is strong and associated with the early components.

Mesangial hypercellularity can occur, especially in patients with secondary forms of MGN, such as SLE, hepatitis B, or gold- or penicillamine-associated disease. In addition to epimembranous and intramembranous deposits, small amounts of immune complex deposition may be seen in the mesangial and/or subendothelial areas.137 Margination of leukocytes in the glomerular capillaries may be an indication of renal vein thrombosis.138 Crescent formation is uncommon and if focal, should suggest secondary MGN (e.g., due to SLE) or a superimposed disease. Diffuse fulminant crescentic disease is a rare and late consequence of the superimposition of anti-GBM or ANCA disease. Rarely, patients with MGN have tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) because of antitubular basement membrane antibodies. These patients are almost invariably children, present with nephrotic syndrome and Fanconi syndrome and progress to ESRD.139

# Diabetic Nephropathy

Diabetic nephropathy is a clinical syndrome characterized by persistent proteinuria, hypertension, and progressive decline in renal function. It is considered to be the leading cause of ESRD, accounting for approximately 40% of the new cases in the United States undergoing long-term dialysis.140 It is estimated that 20%–40% of all diabetic patients will develop diabetic nephropathy.141 In type 1 diabetes, the cumulative incidence of diabetic nephropathy is about 25% after 25–40 years of disease.142 Evidence suggests that the risk of overt nephropathy and progression to ESRD is similar in type 2 diabetes.143 Microalbuminuria is the earliest manifestation of diabetic nephropathy but cannot be detected by standard urine dipstick method. Proteinuria, usually of nonselective type, is the most consistent overt manifestation of diabetic nephropathy. The nephrotic syndrome has been reported in 6%–40% of the cases and constitutes a sign of poor prognosis. About 28%–48% of patients may present with moderate microscopic hematuria. Hypertension is a late complication seen with advanced renal failure. The rate of progression to end-stage kidney disease is dependent on a variety of factors including genetics, environmental factors, therapeutic interventions, and comorbidities. Blacks and Native Americans with type II diabetes mellitus are at greater risk of developing diabetic nephropathy.

The development of diabetic nephropathy is related to multiple factors, and inadequate glycemic control is one of the most important. Persistent hyperglycemia causes accumulation of advanced glycosylated end products in various organs including kidney with resultant injury, tissue remodeling, and extracellular matrix deposition. It also causes defects in mitochondrial electron transport, increased production of reactive oxygen species, and increased oxidative stress. Many cellular proteins, including GBM collagen and matrix proteins, are affected.144

Diabetic microangiopathy occurring throughout the body is the most characteristic morphologic change in the diabetic, and its hallmark is an increase in the amount of vascular basement membrane material. There are no significant morphologic differences in the renal lesions caused by type 1 and type 2 diabetes.145 All areas of the kidney may be affected by diabetes, but the most striking lesions are found in the glomeruli and blood vessels, including diffuse glomerulosclerosis, nodular glomerulosclerosis, and the so-called insudative lesions (fibrin caps, capsular drops, and arteriolar hyalinosis).146 Diabetic glomerulosclerosis is the general term for all of these lesions, and they are considered to be an expression of the microangiopathy.

Notable morphologic characteristics of MGN throughout its evolution are the absence of mesangial hypercellularity and a lack of inflammatory cells within the glomeruli. On occasion, however, diffuse glomerulosclerosis, the most common lesion in diabetic nephropathy, is characterized by a diffuse increase in the mesangial.

Matrix and thickening of the capillary walls (Fig. 23.17). Thickening of the GBM is the most consistent finding in diabetic nephropathy and is often seen in both diffuse and nodular glomerulosclerosis. Although minor degrees of basement membrane thickening are not specific for diabetes, measurement of the basement membrane width is the most effective way to quantitate early diabetic glomerular lesions. In advanced stages, the GBM may be many times its normal thickness, often with accentuation of the normal fibrillar structure. The GBM thickening and mesangial changes can be seen by electron microscopy before the damage is visible by light microscopy. The earliest structural alteration in diabetic glomerulopathy that can be quantified is increased thickness of the GBM, which can be documented as early as 1.5–2.5 years after the onset of type I diabetes mellitus. A clear increase in the mesangial matrix and cellularity can be detected on light microscopy as early as 5–7 years after the onset of diabetes mellitus or within 2–5 years following renal transplantation. Recently, a histologic classification of diabetic nephropathy has been proposed, but its clinical utility has not yet been validated.

Nodular glomerulosclerosis (Kimmelstiel–Wilson lesion) is the characteristic histopathologic lesion in diabetic glomerulosclerosis. It consists of large acellular nodules located in the intercapillary regions (see Fig. 23.17). These nodules vary in size and often have a laminated appearance. They are eosinophilic, argyrophilic, and PAS positive and blue with trichrome stain. Ultrastructurally, the nodules are composed of masses of extracellular mesangial matrix (Fig. 23.18). Both the mesangial widening and the nodules are the result of an increase in the synthesis and/or decrease in the degradation of the mesangial matrix. The capillary loops that surround the nodules may have narrow lumens because of the expansion of the mesangium, but they can also be aneurysmally dilated and some have peripheral mesangial extensions. Focal areas of mesangiolysis may also be present. Diffuse and nodular diabetic glomerulosclerosis can be found together, not only in the same patient, but also in the same glomerulus. Although nodular glomerulosclerosis is virtually pathognomonic of diabetic nephropathy, identical light microscopic lesions can be found in cases of light chain deposition disease (LCDD). In the latter condition, however, the nodules are composed of granular electron-dense material that shows light chain restriction with antibodies to kappa and lambda light chains.

Nodular glomerulosclerosis is characterized by the presence of atubular glomeruli, which can also be found in diabetic glomerulosclerosis as a late manifestation of the disease, predominantly in patients with proteinuria. Atubular glomeruli are defined as those glomeruli that have open glomerular capillaries but have lost their connection with the proximal tubule and are presumably nonfunctioning. Although accurate identification of these glomeruli requires serial sections, small glomeruli surrounded by tissue with marked tubular loss are most probably atubular.

The most characteristic tubular change is diffuse thickening of the tubular basement membrane. When the disease is advanced, there is also TA and interstitial scarring that may be accompanied by chronic inflammatory infiltrate. The presence of interstitial neutrophils or tubular neutrophil casts should raise concern for superimposed acute pyelonephritis. Glycogen vacuolization of the renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (Armanni–Ebstein lesion), associated with uncontrolled hyperglycemia, was common in the past, but is rarely seen today.

The classification of amyloidosis is based on the type of precursor protein that forms the amyloid fibrils and the distribution of the amyloid deposits as to whether it is systemic or localized (see Table 23.3). By convention, the amyloid fibril type is designated A for amyloid, followed by an abbreviated form of the name of the fibril protein. Amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis (formerly known as “primary” or “associated with multiple myeloma”) is the most common form of systemic amyloidosis in the Western world. In this type of amyloidosis, the amyloid fibrils are composed of the N-terminal residues of the variable region of an immunoglobulin light chain. The specific amino acid sequences and post-translational modifications of light chains confer the amyloidogenicity. A minority have overt multiple myeloma, while others have monoclonal spike in the serum and/or urine. The amyloidogenic light chains are more frequently lambda than kappa type, in contrast to normal or cast nephropathy light chains. Rarely, the amyloid deposits are derived from monoclonal immunoglobulin light and heavy chains or just heavy chains, and the disease is referred to as AHL amyloidosis or AH amyloidosis, respectively.

Amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis (formerly known as secondary amyloidosis) is a rare complication of persistent inflammation that may develop in patients affected by chronic rheumatic diseases, long-lasting infections, inflammatory bowel disease, periodic fever syndromes, familial Mediterranean fever, and malignancies. It is the most common type of amyloidosis in the parts of the developing world with endemic tuberculosis and leprosy. In this type of amyloidosis, the AA amyloid deposits are formed by the N-terminal proteolytic fragments of the acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A (SAA), a polymorphic apolipoprotein of high density that, upon chronic inflammatory stimuli, may reach persistently high plasma concentrations. Certain polymorphisms in SAA gene appear to confer increased risk of developing AA amyloidosis in patients.

Hereditary systemic amyloidosis is a diverse group of autosomal dominant, late-onset (sometimes sixth or seventh decade of life) disorders that occurs much less frequently than AL or AA amyloidosis. These amyloidoses are caused by mutations in the genes coding for some plasma proteins, including transthyretin, apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein A-II, apolipoprotein A-IV, fibrinogen A α-chain, gelsolin, cystatin C, and lysozyme. Specific amino acid substitutions allow each of these soluble circulating proteins to be prone to aggregate and form amyloid fibrils in organs and tissues. The natural history of these conditions varies by the protein, as well as the tissue distribution. For example, transthyretin amyloidosis, which is the most common form of hereditary systemic amyloidosis, typically affects the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems, manifesting as progressive sensory–motor neuropathy, gastrointestinal and bladder dysfunction, impotence, and orthostatic hypotension, whereas apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein A-II, apolipoprotein A-IV, fibrinogen α-chain, and lysozyme amyloidosis are more often associated with a marked visceral burden of amyloid that clinically results in progressive kidney and liver disease.

Familial Mediterranean fever is a common form of the nephropathic familial amyloidoses. The deposits of amyloid in this condition consist of amyloid AA, and, in contrast to other forms of familial amyloidosis which are autosomal dominant, familial Mediterranean fever is associated with autosomal recessive inheritance. Mutations in MEFV gene encoding pyrin/marenostrin result in activation of IL-1β pathway with subsequent elevations of SAA levels, especially during febrile episodes. Other related periodic fever syndromes due to mutations in genes encoding cryopyrin, and tumor necrosis factor also cause autoinflammation with eventual precipitation of AA amyloid.

A subtype of amyloidosis of ill-defined etiology is ALECT2, characterized by accumulation of leukocyte chemotactic factor 2. No mutation in LECT2 gene has been identified, but all sequenced.

Cases show a specific polymorphism. Produced in the liver, LECT2 is a plasma cytokine that increases the phagocytic and bacteriocidal activity of macrophages. ALECT2 is typically seen in elderly individuals of Mexican ancestry, although other ethnic populations can be affected. These patients often have comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension.

Another form of amyloidosis is dialysis-related amyloidosis, a serious complication in patients undergoing long-term dialysis that is caused by the deposition of fibrillar β₂-microglobulin (amyloid β₂M). This type of amyloid has a predilection for musculoskeletal deposition. β₂-Amyloid can cause carpal tunnel syndrome and a destructive arthropathy of medium-sized and large joints, especially of the shoulders and knees. Visceral amyloid deposition occurs late, usually after 15 years of hemodialysis, and may involve the heart, liver, lungs, and gastrointestinal system. End-stage kidneys may also be involved by β₂-microglobulin amyloidosis, but this has no clinical significance.

Nonselective proteinuria, with or without the nephrotic syndrome, is the most common manifestation of renal involvement by amyloidosis. Approximately 25% of the patients with AL amyloidosis have the nephrotic syndrome at diagnosis, and a total of about 40% will develop the syndrome during the course of the disease. Over 90% of patients with AA amyloidosis have renal insufficiency or nephrotic syndrome at diagnosis; however, the degree of proteinuria does not correlate with the extent of the amyloid deposition in the kidney. The prognosis for a patient with renal amyloidosis is poor, especially in those with AL amyloidosis.

Because the kidney is frequently affected in AL, AA, and several familial amyloidoses, a kidney biopsy is often a method by which the disease is identified. Amyloid can be found anywhere in the kidney but especially accumulates in glomeruli. Deposition is initially mesangial, producing diffuse widening of axial areas but progressively involves the capillary walls. The fibrils of AL and AA amyloidosis can be distinguished by pretreating tissue sections with potassium permanganate before the Congo red staining. Under these conditions, AA amyloid fibrils lose their affinity for the Congo red stain, and the birefringence is lost, whereas AL amyloid is not affected. This technique, however, is not as reliable as immunostaining with currently available AA antibodies.

In the early stages of renal involvement when histochemical preparations fail to detect the deposits of amyloid, electron microscopy is the only method available to establish the diagnosis. Ultrastructurally, the amyloid fibrils in tissue sections form random aggregates of rigid, nonbranching fibrils measuring 8–10 nm in diameter (Fig. 23.22). Initially, the amyloid is seen in mesangium and the deposition subsequently extends into the subendothelial zone and through the basement membrane. When amyloid penetrates the basement membrane, epithelial foot processes are effaced and are often separated from the membrane.

Because the amyloidogenic light chain in AL amyloidosis is produced by clonal plasma cells, immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase studies will show restrictive immunoreactivity for either kappa or, more frequently, lambda light chain. It should be emphasized, however, that a negative reaction for both light chains does not exclude the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. This is because the main constituent of amyloid deposits in some cases of AL amyloidosis is the light chain variable region alone and the commercially available antibodies are typically raised against the light chain constant region.175 Monoclonal heavy chain staining (IgG, IgA, or IgM) may instead be seen in AH amyloidosis or may be present in addition to light chain restriction, as in AHL amyloidosis. Sometimes the “stickiness” of amyloid causes nonspecific immunoglobulin staining and an erroneous subtyping of amyloid deposits.175 Amyloid A usually can be demonstrated by the currently available anti-AA protein.

Antibodies. Since amyloid P component is present in all types of amyloid, it can be used as a pan-amyloid marker to highlight the extent of amyloid deposition. It is important to keep in mind, however, that amyloid P component is not specific for amyloid and is present in the organized deposits of immunotactoid glomerulopathy and in normal GBM and blood vessels; therefore, a positive stain does not denote the presence of true amyloid deposition, and it is necessary to establish the presence of amyloid by a positive Congo red stain.

# Immunotactoid Glomerulopathy

Although initially described together with fibrillary glomerulonephritis, immunotactoid glomerulopathy is recognized as a distinct entity. When strict diagnostic criteria are used, immunotactoid glomerulopathy is exceedingly rare, occurring with only one-tenth the frequency of fibrillary glomerulonephritis. Although the clinical presentation of immunotactoid glomerulopathy is quite similar to that of fibrillary glomerulonephritis, these conditions differ in that immunotactoid glomerulopathy tends to occur in older individuals and is more likely to have an associated monoclonal gammopathy or lymphoproliferative malignancy, serum M-spike, and a worse long-term survival. Approximately 40% of immunotactoid glomerulopathy patients have associated hypocomplementemia suggestive of complement activation by pathogenic immunoglobulins.

The light microscopy findings are variable and amorphous Congo red negative deposits are often seen in the mesangium and capillary walls. The immunotactoid deposits consist of microtubular structures with a hollow core ranging from 30 to 50 nm in width and arranged in parallel or stacked arrays. The vast majority of immunotactoid deposits (in 70%–90% of patients) are composed of monoclonal light chains, most often kappa type. When such monotypic deposits are seen in immunotactoid glomerulopathy, the IgG deposits often belong to IgG1 subclass.

# Fibrillary Glomerulonephritis

Fibrillary glomerulonephritis is characterized by extracellular deposition of nonbranching, randomly arrayed fibrils approximately 10–30 nm in diameter. Reported in just 0.5%–1.0% of the cases in three large series of native kidney biopsies, it most commonly affects middle-aged adults but can also occur in older individuals and children as young as 10 years of age. It is more common in whites than in blacks (ratio 8.3 : 1) and affects females more often than males (1.8 : 1). Patients typically present with heavy proteinuria, often in the nephrotic range. Microscopic hematuria is common, but on occasion gross hematuria may occur. About 75% of patients develop hypertension, sometimes severe. Low serum complements are only rarely encountered in fibrillary glomerulonephritis. No specific serum or urine protein abnormalities have been recorded, and the patients have a low incidence of associated lymphoproliferative malignancy. The prognosis for patients with fibrillary glomerulonephritis is poor. Roughly half of these patients progress to ESRD within 2 years of the initial diagnosis. Fibrillary glomerulonephritis has been reported to recur in almost a third of the patients who undergo renal transplantation.

The light microscopic findings of fibrillary glomerulonephritis can be variable. Common features include mesangial hypercellularity, mesangial expansion with amorphous PAS-positive material, and thickening of the glomerular capillary walls. The overall appearance of the lesions can resemble mesangial proliferative, membranoproliferative, focal and diffuse proliferative, and MGN. Crescents are not uncommon and can occur in about one-fourth to one-third of cases. An important characteristic of these amorphous deposits is that they do not stain with Congo red or thioflavin T stains (thus differentiating them from amyloid fibrils) and they are observed in the absence of circulating cryoglobulins.

Ultrastructurally, the deposits can be found in all glomerular compartments, including the mesangium, GBM, and subendothelial and subepithelial areas. The fibrillary deposits in fibrillary glomerulonephritis are randomly oriented and measure 10–30 nm in diameter. In rare cases of fibrillary glomerulonephritis, fibrils have been reported in the peritubular capillary walls and in the tubular basement membrane. Patients usually exhibit extensive effacement of the podocyte foot processes, a finding that correlates with severe proteinuria observed in these patients. Immunofluorescence microscopy most often reveals IgG and C3 in a distribution that corresponds to the fibrillary deposits. On occasion, small amounts of IgM and IgA can also be seen. With regard to the light chain deposition disease (LCDD), it is a rare systemic disorder caused by the overproduction and extracellular deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain. A minority of cases may also have heavy chain determinants, and these cases are regarded as having light and heavy chain deposition disease (LHCDD). On rare occasion, isolated heavy chain is deposited (HCDD, discussed later), and all these disorders with similar pathology constitute monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD).

Although the principal clinical manifestations are dominated by renal disease, patients may present secondary symptoms produced by cardiac, hepatic, or neural damage. In addition, abnormal light chains can be deposited in many other organs, including the skin, spleen, thyroid gland, adrenal glands, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. LCDD has many histologic features in common with AL amyloidosis; however, in contrast to amyloidosis where the deposits are fibrillar, LCDD deposits are granular, do not stain with Congo red or thioflavin T, and do not contain amyloid P protein. Also, while the deposits in amyloidosis consist mainly of lambda light chains, 80% of LCDD cases are composed of kappa light chains.

The pathogenic light chains in LCDD have unique alterations in the complementarity-determining and framework portions of the variable region. Males are more frequently affected, with a ratio of approximately 2 : 1. About 60%–70% of the reported patients with LCDD have had well-documented multiple myeloma or another lymphoplasmacytic disorder at the time of, or subsequent to, the diagnosis of the nephropathy. Although 15%–20% of patients lack monoclonal light chains in serum or urine by immunofixation method, abnormal serum free light chain ratio is detectable in all patients with LCDD and LHCDD. Serum complement levels are typically normal unless associated with monoclonal heavy chains (as in LHCDD). LCDD occurs more frequently in middle aged to older individuals.

Older individuals, but it has been reported in older children.¹⁹⁷ Most patients present with renal failure associated with heavy and nonselective proteinuria, reaching nephrotic range in over a third.¹⁹¹ Concurrent cast nephropathy has been diagnosed in a third of patients with LCDD and the presenting feature is typically acute renal failure. 189 Microscopic hematuria is common. Renal insufficiency can progress to an end-stage kidney disease, at which time the patient will require dialysis or renal transplant. Without effective treatment to reduce light chain production, LCDD almost invariably recurs after renal transplantation, and the recurrence may occur within weeks to years after transplantation. 198 The prognosis for patients with LCDD is generally poor, and death is often attributed to cardiac disease or complications of infection. 199 The 5-year survival is approximately 70% but is less if there is coexisting multiple myeloma or light chain cast nephropathy.

Affected glomeruli are enlarged, and the deposition of the markedly PAS-positive material produces capillary wall thickening and nodular expansion of the mesangium. The extent of glomerular involvement can vary in a biopsy from minimal mesangial expansion to a fully developed nodular glomerulosclerosis that resembles diabetic glomerulosclerosis, 193 but other morphologic features characteristic of diabetes, such as severe arteriolar hyalinosis, fibrin (see Fig. 23.26B).

for the heavy chain occurs along the glomerular, tubular, and vascular basement membranes and in the mesangium.

# Heavy Chain Deposition Disease

Heavy chain deposition disease (HCDD) is much less common than LCDD. It is characterized by systemic deposition of a monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain. The deposited heavy chain is gamma in most cases, and all subclasses of gamma heavy chain have been reported to participate in the disease. A deletion of the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain has been reported in all documented cases and is likely necessary for the secretion of a free heavy chain by a plasma cell clone of HCDD.

The clinical manifestations and histologic features of HCDD are quite similar to those of LCDD. In contrast to amyloidosis and LCDD, patients with HCDD often manifest hypocomplementemia, possibly due to the complement-fixing properties of IgG subclass deposited. The diagnosis of HCDD can be done by the immunofluorescent demonstration of positivity for heavy chains (usually gamma, IgG) and negativity for both kappa and lambda light chains. The reactivity for heavy chains is crucial for diagnosis.

# Proliferative Glomerulonephritis With Monoclonal Immunoglobulin G Deposits

Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin G deposits (PGNMIGD) is a recently described, rare proliferative glomerular disease with monoclonal immunoglobulin G deposits. It is often seen in middle aged or older individuals, with a female predominance. Over two-thirds of these patients present with nephrotic syndrome and renal impairment, while others have less degrees of proteinuria and hematuria. Despite having monoclonal IgG deposits on kidney biopsy, monoclonal gammopathy is seen in less than 30% of patients and underlying multiple myeloma is rare. A minority of patients (~25%) have reduced serum complement levels, but there is no clinical or serologic evidence of connective tissue disorder or cryoglobulinemia. While some patients may respond to steroids or other immunosuppressive therapy such as rituximab, the response varies.

PGNMIGN is typically a slowly progressive kidney disease that recurs in allografts.²⁰⁵ The light microscopic findings are quite variable with membranoproliferative pattern being the most common; endocapillary proliferation, crescents, membranous, mesangioproliferative, and segmental sclerosis patterns have also been described. 204,206 Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals granular mesangial and capillary wall deposits composed of IgG and C3 with associated light chain restriction (IgG3κ most common); IgM and C1q may sometimes be seen. PGNMIGD is defined by IgG subclass restriction and cannot be rendered without immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of IgG subclasses (IgG1–4). IgG3 deposition is most common (followed by IgG1) in PGNMIGD, and its frequent association with hypocomplementemia is possibly related to its complement-fixing abilities and nephritogenicity. Ultrastructural examination localizes the deposits to mesangium and subendothelium with occasional subepithelial deposits identified. Extraglomerular deposits and organized substructure are not typical features of this entity.

# Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome

The nephrotic syndrome is uncommon in the first year of life²⁰⁷ but is being increasingly recognized that in majority of cases, it is caused by mutations in just one of four genes. 208 The term congenital nephrotic syndrome encompasses a heterogeneous group of conditions but is reserved for patients who present clinical symptoms of nephrotic syndrome at birth or within the first 3 months of life. The nephrotic syndrome often makes its appearance during the first days of life and does not respond to steroid therapy. The disease is progressive during the first 2 years of life, and kidney transplantation is the only successful life-saving treatment. The nephrotic syndrome recurs post transplantation in 20%–30% of cases and is attributed to circulating antinephrin antibodies, detected especially in patients with Fin-major mutations.218,219

A renal biopsy is essential to differentiate these two types of congenital nephrotic syndrome from other renal disorders of the neonatal period, including MGN (associated with congenital syphilis or mercury intoxication), congenital toxoplasmosis, HIV (especially in the offspring of narcotic addicts), malaria, cytomegalovirus infection, and MCD.209–211 In the absence of infections, routine molecular testing of steroid-resistant congenital and infantile nephrotic syndrome is now standard clinical practice. 212

The most striking histologic feature is ectasia of the proximal and distal tubules with flattening of the tubular epithelium (Fig. 23.27). The glomeruli show minimal changes early on but subsequently develop varying degrees of mesangial proliferation, sclerosis, and dilation of the Bowman space. There may also be an increased number of immature glomeruli. Progressive renal disease is associated with increased TA and IF. Obliteration of epithelial foot processes and other podocyte changes seen in MCD are observed by electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence is usually negative for immunoglobulins and complement components, but mesangial and capillary staining for IgM and C3 have been reported in partially sclerosed glomeruli.

# Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome of the Finnish Type

Congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations of the NPHS1 gene located on chromosome 19q13.1.213,214 This gene encodes nephrin protein that is an integral component of the podocyte slit membrane and plays a crucial role in normal glomerular filtration.215,216 The estimated incidence of the disease in the genetically isolated population of Finland is approximately 1 : 10,000 newborns,²¹⁷ but it has been reported, though with much less frequency, throughout the world in families with no known Finnish ancestry.⁴³ More than 70 mutations in NPHS1 gene have been identified worldwide, and majority are frameshift mutations (Fin-major) leading to complete absence of nephrin expression and an early onset severe nephrotic syndrome with rapid progression to end-stage kidney disease. The Fin-minor nonsense mutations result in truncated or nonfunctioning nephrin protein with less severe disease.

The diagnosis may be suspected in utero from the characteristic family history and the finding of elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels in the amniotic fluid and maternal serum, but this is neither highly specific nor sensitive. More recently, NPHS1 gene sequencing for known and novel mutations is being performed for the prenatal diagnosis of the disease. The disease manifests in the fetal stage with heavy proteinuria in utero. At birth, the patients have large placentas, proteinuria, edema, and a high susceptibility to infections.⁴³

# Diffuse Mesangial Sclerosis

DMS is a rare condition characterized by the early onset of severe proteinuria, characteristic glomerular morphology, and rapid progression to end-stage renal failure before the age of 3 years.²²⁰ DMS can occur in an isolated form or associated with some well-characterized syndromes. Denys–Drash syndrome (DDS), a rare autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by early onset nephrotic syndrome, male pseudohermaphroditism, and Wilms tumor. Incomplete forms of the syndrome, consisting of glomerulopathy associated with either genital abnormality or Wilms tumor, have also been described.

The mutations of the WT1 suppressor gene located on chromosome 11p13 have been demonstrated in nearly all patients with the complete or incomplete forms of the syndrome.221,222 Other syndromes described with glomerular pathology of DMS include Galloway–Mowat syndrome (WDR73 gene mutation), Pierson syndrome (LAMB2 gene mutation), and a familial steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (with mutations in PLCE1 gene), all with autosomal recessive modes of inheritance.208,223 Young children with Galloway–Mowat syndrome.

# Diffuse Endocapillary Proliferative Glomerulonephritis

Diffuse endocapillary (or intracapillary) proliferative glomerulonephritis is a term used to describe lesions characterized by both mesangial and endothelial proliferation. Although this category has become virtually synonymous with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, it may occur after infections caused by other bacteria including staphylococci, meningococci, pneumococci, Klebsiella, Salmonella, enterococci, Brucella, Leptospira, and mycobacteria. 224,225 It can also arise as a complication of rickettsial infections; viral diseases including hepatitis B, varicella, mumps, measles, cytomegalic virus, and infectious mononucleosis; and parasitic conditions such as malaria, trichinosis, and toxoplasmosis. 226

# Acute Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis

Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is primarily a disease of childhood, usually occurring between the ages of 5 and 15 years, but it can affect individuals of any age.227 Approximately 5% of the patients are younger than 2 years of age.225 Males are affected more commonly than females, with a ratio of 2:1.226,227 Significantly higher incidence of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is seen in less developed countries when compared to the Western world and may even be underestimated due to subclinical cases.228 The disease profile in developed countries is often different, more frequently affecting elderly individuals with comorbidities.227

The proteins encoded by all these candidate genes have a role in either podocyte differentiation or function of glomerular filtration barrier. A genetic basis for the sporadic cases of DMS is very much plausible but is unclear in most instances. On rare occasions, cytomegalovirus inclusions were identified in newborns with congenital nephrotic syndrome and glomerular changes of DMS.209

In patients with DMS, the nephrotic syndrome can develop as early as the first week of life, but it is more likely to appear after the third month. In contrast to the Finnish type, the nephrotic syndrome in DMS is not associated with a large placenta, premature birth, or low birth weight. DMS does not recur after transplantation.220

By light microscopy, the glomeruli in early DMS show prominent crowded podocytes reminiscent of fetal appearance. Pseudocrescents with proliferating visceral and parietal epithelial cells have been observed.43 Subsequently, the glomeruli display increased mesangial sclerosis and consolidation (Fig. 23.28). In advanced stages, there is marked TA with IF. The findings by electron microscopy are extensive obliteration of the epithelial foot processes, basement membrane thickening and lamellation, and an increase in the mesangial matrix. By immunofluorescence, deposition of IgM, C3, and C1q is demonstrable in the sclerotic mesangial areas.

Clinically, this disease is manifested by a rather abrupt onset of gross hematuria, edema, proteinuria, hypertension, and impaired renal function.228,231 Antibodies to certain streptococcal antigens, such as antistreptolysin O (ASO), are elevated, but this finding may not be helpful in diagnosis due to the ubiquitous nature of streptococcal infections. The serum levels of hemolytic complement activity and C3 protein are abnormally reduced early in the course of the disease, but the values return to normal in less than 8 weeks. During the acute episode of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, 2%–5% of the patients die as a result of complications such as pulmonary edema, hypertensive encephalopathy, or rapidly progressive renal failure; and these figures are much higher in elderly patients.228,232

The long-term prognosis of patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is good, especially in children, with only a small number of patients progressing to chronic renal failure many years after the acute episode.225,233 Recovery in adults is less predictable than in children, especially in elderly patients.

with persistent proteinuria or when the initial episode is associated with severe renal impairment and nephrotic syndrome. 226,227,230 Progression of renal disease is more common in patients who develop crescentic glomerulonephritis. Since the clinical syndrome of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis may be quite distinctive and the overall prognosis is excellent, biopsies are not commonly performed unless atypical features complicate the presentation, such as nephrotic syndrome, anuria, acute renal failure, persistent or severe hypertension, or lack of recovery after 6 weeks. On long-term follow-up, approximately 17% of the patients have persistent mild proteinuria, microhematuria, or hypertension. 230 Recent studies have indicated an overlap between atypical postinfectious glomerulonephritis and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN), as several of these patients with persistent late symptoms have alternative complement pathway abnormalities.234 In addition, it appears that streptococcal infections may act as a trigger for precipitating C3 glomerulopathy in a genetically predisposed individual.235,236

Light microscopic examination of biopsies taken within a few weeks of onset of disease shows diffuse enlargement of the glomerular tufts that tend to narrow the Bowman space. Glomerular intracapillary cellularity is increased due to mesangial proliferation and, to a lesser extent, proliferating and swollen endothelial cells. This results in narrowing of the capillary lumina and accentuation of the lobular glomerular pattern. Infiltration by leukocytes can contribute to the capillary obstruction as well, and, when prominent, the term exudative glomerulonephritis has been used. (Fig. 23.29) Accompanying the polymorphonuclear leukocytes are mononuclear cells and, on occasion, eosinophils. Segmental necrosis and thrombosis with crescent formation are uncommon findings but indicate poor prognosis.

The most characteristic ultrastructural feature in the early stages of the disease is the presence of subepithelial, dome-shaped, electron-dense deposits called humps. (Fig. 23.30) The deposits are separated from the lamina densa by a recognizable lamina rara externa, and the foot processes of the podocytes overlying the humps are usually obliterated. In general, there is a correlation between the number of humps and the degree of polymorphonuclear cell infiltration, but the humps may occur in loops devoid of leukocytes. Intramembranous deposits, some of them in continuity with the humps, and small subendothelial and mesangial deposits are not uncommon.

Immunofluorescence studies during the acute phase of the disease typically reveal granular staining for IgG and C3 along the capillary.

percentage of cases, mesangial hypercellularity, mesangial deposits, an unrecognized infection. Low serum complement levels and subepithelial humps, if present, indicate infection-associated glomerulonephritis rather than IgAN. 226,246

# IgA-Dominant Staphylococcal Infection-Associated Glomerulonephritis

Infection-associated glomerulonephritis in the developed countries is being increasingly caused by *Staphylococcus aureus, especially the drug-resistant strains. 237,238 Unlike poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, staphylococcal infection-associated glomerulonephritides are more common in the elderly population (over 60 years of age) with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, drug abuse, alcoholism, and malignancy. 228,238 The underlying infection is typically ongoing (rather than “post-infection”) and is often brought to attention by the kidney disease. The characteristic feature of this entity is IgA-dominant or co-dominant immune deposits that are seen in addition to C3. 227,239,240 The IgA-dominant host immune responses appear to play a role in this morphologic variant of infection-associated glomerulonephritis. It has been postulated that the S. aureus enterotoxins and possibly other antigens function as “superantigens,” capable of binding directly to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on antigen presenting cells without the required intracellular antigen processing to form receptor-fitting peptides. 241,242 In addition, these superantigens bind to T-cell receptors, causing massive T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine release. These events in turn trigger polyclonal B-cell activation, and patients with S. aureus* infections were shown to have polyclonal elevation of serum IgA and IgG. The most common presentation is acute renal injury, proteinuria often in the nephrotic range, and hematuria. 239,243 There appears to be a male predominance, and two-thirds of the patients have mild hypocomplementemia. A small percentage of patients may present with lower extremity rash, reminiscent of Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP). 226,244 Reported underlying infections have included osteomyelitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis, empyema, sinusitis, and endocarditis, among others. The latent period between the onset of infection and renal manifestations appears to be 4–5 weeks, but in most cases the infection is not recognized until the time of the kidney biopsy. Treatment of underlying infection is the main form of therapy and overall, the prognosis is inferior to poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, possibly related to the patient’s age and associated comorbidities.

The glomerular changes on biopsy can be variable, 226 ranging from mild mesangial hypercellularity to diffuse endocapillary proliferation and on occasion, crescents; exudative features are not uncommon, although seen less frequently than in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. There is usually accompanying acute tubular injury and interstitial inflammation, but vasculitis is not a feature observed on kidney biopsy. In patients with diabetes mellitus, subtle changes of glomerular endocapillary proliferation may be masked by prominent Kimmelstiel–Wilson nodules. 245 The electron-dense deposits are primarily in the mesangium and paramesangium, but occasional subendothelial deposits are not uncommon. The subepithelial “humps,” the hallmark of infection-related glomerulonephritis, are seen in less than 50% of patients. When present, these subepithelial deposits are often smaller and less “hump”-like. The glomerular immune deposits are composed predominantly of IgA and C3 with less intense or absent IgG. Light chain κ and λ staining is usually seen, and λ can be more intense than κ. These immunofluorescence findings can lead to a misdiagnosis of IgAN, especially in the absence of obvious infection or if the skin rash is reminiscent of HSP. Distinguishing between these two entities is extremely important as immunosuppression for a presumed IgAN will exacerbate the loops.

- C3 glomerulonephritis
- Familial C3 glomerulopathy (abnormal CFHR3-1 protein, type III MPGN features)

- Idiopathic MPGN (immune complex deposition; C3 and immunoglobulin deposition)
- MPGN type I morphology

CFHR, Complement factor H-related protein or gene; MGUS, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance; MPGN, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

Although the traditional subdivision of MPGN implied various morphologic patterns of a single clinicopathologic entity, the conditions do not share a common pathogenesis and they are linked only by the morphologic similarities on routine light microscopy. Recent studies have helped gain insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of “MPGN” and related entity of C3GN. Although the classification scheme is evolving, these disorders fall broadly into two categories (Box 23.4). The first, C3 glomerulopathy, consists of glomerular diseases with prominent C3 deposition with little or no immunoglobulin deposition. It encompasses DDD, C3GN, and familial forms of MPGN and is associated with dysregulation of alternative complement pathway. A subset of previously designated MPGN type I and type III belongs to C3 glomerulopathy category under this new classification. The second group, idiopathic MPGN with prominent immune complex deposition (in addition to C3), includes approximately 70% of type I and 60% type III MPGN, as defined by the traditional classification. Several patients in the second group also appear to have alternative complement pathway abnormalities, posing a challenge for an immunofluorescence-based classification system.

C3 glomerulopathy is characterized by abnormal persistent activation of alternative complement pathway and predominant glomerular deposition of C3, with a proposed definition of C3 immunofluorescence intensity ≥2 levels (scale 0–3+) above immunoglobulins or C1q. These patients often have genetic abnormalities of, or circulating autoantibodies directed against, complement components. Serum C3 levels are often reduced, and histology is variable, including some with membranoproliferative features. The main entities in this category are DDD and C3GN. Others include familial forms with type III MPGN features caused by an abnormal complement factor H-related protein (CFHR3-1), and an autosomal dominant form with mutations in CFHR5. It is interesting that some patients with “atypical” postinfectious glomerulonephritis have been described. DDD, previously termed as type II MPGN, is a C3 glomerulopathy characterized by a unique broad, linear intramembranous electron-dense deposits. DDD is rare and has been estimated to affect two to three people per one million population. Both sexes are equally affected, with the diagnosis usually made in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years. Affected patients typically present with nephrotic proteinuria, hematuria, and renal insufficiency. Most patients with DDD have hypocomplementemia and continue to have low levels of complement throughout the course of the disease. C4 levels are usually normal. Over 80% of patients with DDD.

are positive for serum C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF), an autoantibody directed against C3bBb, a convertase of the alternative pathway of complement cascade. Because C3NeF can be found in idiopathic MPGN and C3GN (previously type I and III MPGN), a definitive diagnosis of DDD depends on the ultrastructural demonstration of dense deposits within the GBM. Other unusual aspect of DDD is its association with macular degeneration and acquired partial lipodystrophy (loss of subcutaneous fat in upper half of the body) in approximately 3%–5% of cases. Patients with these conditions were found to have hypocomplementemia and C3NeF regardless of whether or not they develop DDD. 265–269

DDD has a poor prognosis and in about 50% of the cases, the lesion slowly progresses to an end-stage kidney within 10–15 years of diagnosis. Abrupt decline in renal function can be seen with crescentic disease. On rare occasions, there have been reports of morphologic regression.270–272 Recurrence after renal transplantation occurs in virtually all renal allografts.²⁷³ Chronic activation of alternative complement pathway is the culprit and is mediated in most instances by C3NeF that inhibits the activation blocker, C3 convertase among others.²⁷⁶

Other less common autoantibodies documented in DDD are against factor H, factor B, and C3. Genetic predisposition plays a role and mutations in CFH gene have been detected in 17% of patients. Certain allelic variants of CFH, CFI, C3, and CFHR5 and C3 mutations have been associated with DDD. 257,258,262 It appears that infections, chemotherapy, and other unknown factors may precipitate DDD in these predisposed patients. Interestingly, adults with DDD may have coexistent monoclonal gammopathy, and the pathogenic light (or heavy) chains interfere with the control of the alternative complement pathway.²⁷⁴

On light microscopy, the general morphologic features can be quite variable. In a study of a large series of renal biopsies, nearly half showed mild, mesangial hypercellularity, whereas only about 25% had the typical membranoproliferative pattern (see Figs. 23.32 and 23.33). Approximately 17% had a crescentic glomerulonephritis pattern (Fig. 23.35), and 12% had an acute proliferative and exudative pattern that could be easily confused with postinfectious glomerulonephritis.²⁴⁷ A feature that establishes the diagnosis is an eosinophilic, refractile, and ribbon-like thickening of the basement membrane, which is most pronounced along the GBM, although it can be seen in the Bowman capsule and in the tubular basement membrane. The deposited material is strongly PAS positive, stains blue with Masson trichrome, is pale on Jones stain, and can easily be recognized by its dark color on toluidine blue–stained.

No immunoglobulin staining was observed by immunofluorescence (anti-C3).

C3GN is a type of C3 glomerulopathy characterized by isolated C3 deposits, minimal or no immunoglobulin deposition, and dysregulated alternative complement pathway. However, unlike DDD, the electron-dense deposits are amorphous and not as electron dense, broad, or linear. It includes majority of cases previously designated as type I and III MPGN and other glomerulonephritides without membranoproliferative morphology. Patients with C3GN are often adults, with a mean age of 30 years at presentation, but it has been reported in children as young as 7 years and elderly individuals older than 70 years. The renal manifestations are variable, ranging from mild proteinuria to nephrotic syndrome. Microscopic hematuria, hypertension, and renal insufficiency are frequently present. Serum complement C3 levels are low in approximately 40% of patients, but C4 is typically normal. C3NeF is detectable in approximately 45% of patients. Older individuals with C3GN can also have circulating monoclonal immunoglobulins, although a direct pathogenic link to C3GN has not been established.

The light microscopic findings of C3GN are variable, ranging from minimal changes to diffuse proliferative to membranoproliferative patterns that confer higher risk of developing disease.

# Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis With Immune Complexes

This group of diseases is characterized by mesangial hypercellularity and GBM duplication, with prominent C3 and immunoglobulin (and/or C1q) deposition, indicative of both classical and alternative complement pathway activation.254,279 Extrapolating the historical data of type I MPGN, it likely accounts for approximately 5% of ESRD cases secondary to glomerulonephritis. Membranoproliferative pattern with immune complexes can be primary/idiopathic or more commonly, secondary to chronic infections, monoclonal gammopathy, systemic autoimmunity, and hereditary diseases (see Box 23.4). It is also believed that the majority of cases once thought to be “idiopathic” are associated with hepatitis C infection.²⁸⁰ Further, recent advances in elucidating the pathogenetic mechanisms of MPGN, especially C3 glomerulopathy, has altered the prevalence of “idiopathic” MPGN. It is now a diagnosis of exclusion, especially in adults, and perhaps will become an increasingly uncommon diagnosis in the future.279,281

Based on the historical data, primary/idiopathic form of the disease affects primarily children and young adults, with 90% of patients being between 8 and 16 years of age at the time of diagnosis. 275,282 Onset before the age of 4 years is rare. Clinical presentation varies, and there does not appear to be a gender predominance. At least 50% of the patients present with nephrotic syndrome, and 25% may present with a combination of asymptomatic hematuria and asymptomatic proteinuria. Finally, up to one-third of patients may present with acute nephritic syndrome associated with abnormal urinary sediment, hypertension, and renal insufficiency. 275,282,283

Immunofluorescence usually demonstrates a granular reaction for IgG and C3 along the capillary walls and mesangium (Fig. 23.38). About two-thirds of the patients have hypocomplementemia with marked variation of its level over the course of the disease. In addition, IgM, C1q, and C4 can be present. Electron microscopy demonstrates that the mesangial areas are enlarged by cellular proliferation and accumulated matrix, and that the capillary lumina are reduced by a combination of peripheral mesangial expansion and interposition of cells and matrix beneath the endothelium. The predominant complement depletion is C3, but early (i.e., C1q, C4, and C2) and terminal (C5, C6, C7, and C9) components of the classic pathway of complement activation may be reduced as well. Components of the alternative pathway (i.e., factor B), are also frequently low,²⁸⁴ and C3NeF is detected in more than half of patients with type I MPGN. Mutations in alternative complement pathway genes (CFH and CFI) have been detected in a minority of these patients (with type I pattern), blurring the line between the categories of C3 glomerulopathy and MPGN with immune complexes. 257

It has been speculated that in these cases, the underlying genetic or acquired complement dysregulation is triggered or exacerbated by the immune complex deposition²⁵¹ Historically, the clinical course of “primary/idiopathic” MPGN is usually indolent but relentless, progressing to renal failure over a period of 10 or more years. 285 The disease has been reported to recur in 30%–50% of the patients who undergo renal transplantation273,286 and the risk of recurrence appears to be higher in patients with low serum complement levels.²⁸⁷

On light microscopy, the glomeruli appear diffusely enlarged, with thickening of the capillary walls and prominent mesangial proliferation that produces lobulation of the tuft (see Fig. 23.32). Mesangial matrix accumulates in the center of the lobules, forming nodules resembling diabetic glomerulosclerosis. In addition to the lobular pattern, exudative, crescentic, and focal segmental histologic variants have been described. 283 In sections stained with PAS or Jones methenamine silver stain, continuation of the mesangial matrix can be seen to surround capillary loops, producing a double contour or “tram-track” pattern (see Fig. 23.33). Within the double contours, hyaline material corresponding to subendothelial deposits are often prominent. The presence of hyaline thrombi within the capillary lumens should raise the possibility of cryoglobulinemia or lupus nephritis. Only IgAN is discussed in this section.

Rewrite the following pathology text into a more formal and comprehensive paragraph suitable for a pathology report. STATEMENT: # Glomerular Lesions Associated With the Syndrome of Acute Nephritis


IgA Nephropathy is defined by the predominant deposition of IgA in the glomerular mesangium. The distribution of IgAN varies greatly among different geographic regions of the world. It is the most common primary glomerular disease diagnosed in some Asian countries, including Japan, mainland China, and Singapore, accounting for about one-third of all renal biopsy diagnoses in these regions, 20% in Europe, and 10% in the United States. The cause of these wide differences in incidence has partially been attributed to differences in the indication for renal biopsy in Asia when compared to the United States. Familial clustering has been reported in approximately 10% of the patients. The familial forms of IgAN follow autosomal dominant transmission with incomplete penetrance. The first-degree relatives without clinical evidence of IgAN have high levels of galactose-deficient IgA (GD-IgA). Genome-wide associated studies using single nucleotide polymorphisms have revealed several susceptibility loci, the most common being MHC locus on 6p21. These studies have also highlighted the role of mucosal defense systems and alternative complement pathway in the pathogenesis of IgAN.

The diagnosis of IgAN is primarily based on the demonstration of IgA deposits in the mesangium, a feature seen in association with several conditions. HSP nephritis and IgAN are two closely related conditions that form part of the syndrome. Mesangial IgA deposition has also been described in association with a variety of diseases, including chronic liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, connective tissue disorders, neoplastic diseases, and viral and bacterial infections. IgAN results from the deposition of circulating immune complexes in the glomerular mesangium, leading to the activation of the complement cascade via the alternative pathway. The deposited IgA in idiopathic form is predominantly aberrantly glycosylated polymeric IgA. The serum levels of this GD-IgA are elevated in IgAN patients and this is reportedly an independent risk factor for progression of renal disease.

IgAN can occur at any age, but it is more common in the second and third decades. It is uncommon in children under the age of 10. Males are affected two to six times more often than females. Most patients are diagnosed upon detection of microscopic hematuria during routine physical examination. About less than half the patients have a history of recurrent episodes of macroscopic hematuria, one-third of which occurred synchronously or within a few days after a respiratory or, less commonly, a gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection. This may be related to increased host IgA response to mucosal antigens. Patients often have proteinuria, which is usually mild though it can on occasion be severe. Roughly 5%–10% develop the nephrotic syndrome. It is currently estimated that 25%–40% of the cases slowly progress to chronic renal failure over a period of 20 years. About 60% of the patients who received transplants experienced recurrence of the disease in the donor kidney and a small percentage of them lose their graft to recurrent disease.

It is now recognized that IgAN may display a wide variety of histologic patterns, ranging from normal or nearly normal to a diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis. Widening of the mesangium by increased matrix and hypercellularity is the most common microscopic finding. The mesangial involvement is often uneven and varies among the glomeruli and glomerular lobules. Healing of the focal proliferative lesion may lead to FSGS. Glomerular scarring is associated with TA and IF. Various classification systems, such as Haas and more recently Oxford, are used to score and characterize the histologic features, and several studies have validated these systems in predicting the renal outcomes. By electron microscopy, it is possible to demonstrate mesangial deposits in all glomeruli, indicating that the lesion is diffuse, not focal. On occasion, small subendothelial or subepithelial deposits may also be found, especially in patients with more severe disease.

The immunofluorescence pattern parallels the distribution of the deposits seen by electron microscopy. There is strong diffuse mesangial reactivity for IgA, and it can extend into the capillary loops. IgG is also common and may rival IgA in intensity. About one-third of the cases show weak reactivity for IgM and fibrinogen. C3 reactivity is strong, with a pattern identical to immunoglobulins, but no reactivity for either C1q or C4 is seen, indicating that the complement is activated via the alternative pathway. Deposits of IgA are not limited to the glomeruli in IgAN. They can also be demonstrated in the blood vessels of the superficial dermis of normal-appearing skin in patients with IgAN without systemic manifestations of HSP.

# Crescentic Glomerulonephritis

Crescentic glomerulonephritis is a histopathologic term used to designate a severe form of glomerulonephritis in which 50% or more of the glomeruli are involved by epithelial crescents. This type of glomerular injury is associated with a clinical syndrome known as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis that is characterized by the rapid and progressive loss of renal function accompanied by hematuria, red cell casts in urine, variable degrees of proteinuria, and severe oliguria. Untreated, this disease can result in death within weeks. The terms crescentic glomerulonephritis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis are often used interchangeably. Like crescentic glomerulonephritis, extracapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis is a pathologic term for this lesion which indicates that the cell proliferation is primarily in the Bowman space.

All three of the previous terms are considered proper designations for this form of glomerular injury. Studies using cell markers showed that the crescents are composed of a mixed population of cells primarily consisting of glomerular epithelial cells and macrophages. It has been postulated that crescent formation results from disruption of the glomerular capillaries that allows leukocytes, fibrin, and other plasma proteins to escape into the Bowman space, where they induce epithelial cell proliferation and macrophage maturation that together produce cellular crescents (Fig. 23.42). This is supported by the invariable immunofluorescent finding of fibrin in active crescentic glomerulonephritis (Fig. 23.43) and the demonstration of GBM ruptures that are better visualized on silver-stained histologic preparations or by electron microscopy (Fig. 23.44). As the disease progresses, the extracapillary proliferating cells are transformed into fibroepithelial crescents which incorporate fibroblasts and collagen. Over time, the sclerosis progresses and the glomeruli become completely scarred.

Crescentic glomerulonephritis can be caused by a wide variety of diseases either restricted to the kidney or systemic. Using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy techniques, three main categories that reflect different pathogenic mechanisms have been identified: (1) anti-GBM glomerulonephritis; (2) immune complex crescentic glomerulonephritis; and (3) pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis, usually associated with ANCA (Table 23.4). In each group, the disease may be associated with a known disorder or may be idiopathic.

# Antiglomerular Basement Membrane Disease

This form of glomerulonephritis is characterized by the immunofluorescent demonstration of linear deposits of IgG and, in many instances, C3 along the GBM. Anti-GBM disease is a rare autoimmune disease and accounts for 15% of the cases of crescentic glomerulonephritis. It can occur as a renal-limited disease or as a pulmonary renal syndrome induced by a cross reaction of the anti-GBM antibodies with pulmonary basement membranes (Goodpasture syndrome).

The incidence of anti-GBM disease has two peaks with respect to patient age. The first is in the second and third decades of life, has a male predominance, and a higher frequency of pulmonary involvement (Goodpasture syndrome). The second occurs in the sixth and seventh decades, has a female predominance, and is more often a renal-limited disease.

Renal anti-GBM disease is typically characterized by an abrupt onset of acute glomerulonephritis with severe oliguria or anuria. On rare occasions, however, the onset is more insidious and the patient may remain essentially asymptomatic until the development of uremic symptoms. Patients with Goodpasture syndrome present with glomerulonephritis and pulmonary involvement, which is more often in the form of severe pulmonary hemorrhage. A preceding upper respiratory infection has been documented in about one-fourth of these patients. Pulmonary hemorrhage has also been observed after exposure to various inhalants, particularly hydrocarbons, and there is an association with cigarette smoking.

The circulating anti-GBM antibodies can be detected by enzyme immunoassay, but the titers do not correlate with disease severity. Treatment includes cytotoxic agents and plasmapheresis, but serum creatinine at presentation greater than 5 mg/dL is associated with poor prognosis.

The principal antigen to which anti-GBM antibodies react is localized to the carboxyl terminus of the NC1 domain of the α3 chain of type IV collagen (Goodpasture epitope). It has been suggested that hydrocarbons inhibit the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of sulfilimine bonds between collagen hexamers, thus causing conformational change, neo-epitope exposure, and subsequent autoantibody formation against the Goodpasture antigen. Genetic predisposition may play a role, and there is a strong association between certain HLA class II antigens and risk of developing anti-GBM nephritis.

Anti-GBM disease can complicate other diseases. It can arise de novo following renal transplantation in patients with Alport syndrome and has been reported in association with membranous nephropathy preceding, concurrent with, or following this disease.

Up to one-third of the patients with anti-GBM disease have circulating ANCA, especially with specificity for myeloperoxidase (MPO).

Figure 23.45 Continuous linear IgG reactivity along the capillary walls in a case of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis (anti-IgG). The presence of ANCA in patients with anti-GBM disease is associated with small vessel vasculitis in various organs in addition to lung and kidney.

The typical light microscopic lesion in renal anti-GBM disease is that of a necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescent formation either in a focal or diffuse pattern. In the involved areas, the glomerular capillaries are disrupted and clusters of granulocytes are often present, but there is minimal intracapillary cell proliferation. The uninvolved segments may appear normal or slightly infiltrated by leukocytes or mononuclear inflammatory cells. The most severely involved glomeruli may exhibit extensive necrosis, disruption of the Bowman capsule, and intense periglomerular inflammation with multinucleated giant cells. Electron microscopy may demonstrate the presence of a subendothelial lucent zone near foci of necrosis, but this is not a constant or specific feature. Disruptions of the GBM and fibrin deposition can also be seen. An important negative ultrastructural finding in anti-GBM disease is the absence of electron-dense deposits.

Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate a continuous linear immunostaining of the glomerular capillaries for IgG, often accompanied by a focal linear staining for C3 and in several instances both κ and λ (Fig. 23.45). Distal tubules also express α3 chain, and hence, linear tubular basement membrane staining with IgG is not uncommon. It must be kept in mind that a similar IgG immunofluorescence pattern of GBM can be seen in other glomerular lesions, including diabetic nephropathy and HCDD, so it is necessary to confirm the diagnostic impression with the demonstration of circulating anti-GBM antibodies. It is helpful to note that diabetic nephropathy is usually associated with strong linear staining of all basement membranes with albumin in addition to IgG; HCDD has diffuse linear staining of vascular and tubular basement membranes, in addition to GBM, with IgG.

# Immune Complex Crescentic Glomerulonephritis

Immune complex crescentic glomerulonephritis represents about 25% of all cases of crescentic glomerulonephritis. It occurs most frequently as a complication of any of the immune complex glomerulonephritides, including postinfectious glomerulonephritis, MPGN, cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis, SLE, IgAN, and HSP (Fig. 23.46). In a minority of the cases of immune complex crescentic glomerulonephritis, the underlying cause cannot be determined.

These patients are diagnosed as having idiopathic immune complex glomerulonephritis, and underlying infection should always be excluded in these cases. The prognosis of idiopathic immune complex crescentic glomerulonephritis, although poor, is better than that of anti-GBM disease. The light microscopic features of immune complex crescentic glomerulonephritis depend upon the underlying glomerular disease. The glomerular segments adjacent to the crescents usually present some degree of necrosis, but this is not as extensive as that seen in anti-GBM or pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. An important finding that can help distinguish immune complex crescentic glomerulonephritis from both anti-GBM and pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis is the presence of various combinations of capillary wall thickening and mesangial/endocapillary cell proliferation, features that are typically absent in the latter two types of crescentic glomerulonephritis (Fig. 23.47). Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence allow the confirmation of immune complex deposits, thus establishing the diagnosis of immune complex crescentic glomerulonephritis. The diagnosis of a specific category of immune complex crescentic glomerulonephritis can usually be achieved by the careful correlation of the patient’s clinical and laboratory data with light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic findings.

# Pauci-Immune Crescentic Glomerulonephritis

Pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis is characterized by the absence or minimal staining for immunoglobulin by immunofluorescence. It is the most common form of crescentic glomerulonephritis diagnosed by renal biopsy (about 60% of the cases), more frequently affects elderly individuals, and is equally distributed between the genders.

Pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis can occur as a renal-limited disease or as a component of systemic necrotizing small vessel vasculitis. Constitutional symptoms include fever, arthralgias, and myalgias, and the extrarenal manifestations in systemic disease vary by the organ/s affected. Patients with pauci-immune

The light microscopic appearance of pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis is indistinguishable from that of anti-GBM disease (see Fig. 23.47). Immunoﬂuorescence studies may reveal small irregular focal staining for C3. Fibrinogen is frequently found in the crescents or in the necrotic areas of the glomerular tuft. Electron microscopy often demonstrates ruptures of the GBM as well as ﬁbrin deposition. The absence of immune complex deposits differentiates pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis from immune complex crescentic glomerulonephritis.

# Lupus Nephritis

SLE is a multisystem, autoimmune disease with a broad range of clinical presentation that has a high morbidity and mortality. The American Rheumatism Association has established diagnostic criteria for this condition based on clinical and serologic manifestations.³³⁷

SLE can affect adults as well as children; two-thirds of patients present symptoms between 16 and 30 years of age. In children, SLE usually occurs in adolescence; it is uncommon before the age of 10 and very rare before the age of 5. 338,339 It is 10 times more common in females than males, with black females being affected more frequently than white. A drug-induced lupus-like disease, most commonly linked with hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid, methyldopa, chlorpromazine, and quinidine, has also been recognized.340,341 The renal lesions in these cases are similar to those seen in spontaneous SLE.

Pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis tend to respond better to treatment than those with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis and, therefore, have a better prognosis. Treatment options for remission induction include steroids, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, and disease relapses are not uncommon.328–330 Approximately 80%–90% of pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis cases occur in ANCA-positive patients. 328 ANCAs have been recognized as serologic markers for pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with or without evidence of extrarenal disease. 331,332 By indirect immunoﬂuorescence with ethanol-fixed neutrophils as substrate, two distinct immunostaining patterns have been recognized: cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) and perinuclear (P-ANCA). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has shown that most C-ANCA– and P-ANCA–positive sera recognize proteinase 3 (PR3), which is a serine protease of 29 kDa, and MPO, respectively. Both are localized to the azurophilic granules of the neutrophils and monocytes, are translocated to the cell surface during cell activation, and are thus able to interact directly with circulating ANCA. Subsequent activation of cell signal transduction pathways and alternative complement pathway facilitate leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and vessel damage.

Patients with pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis without evidence of extrarenal vasculitis most often have P-ANCA/MPO-ANCA, those with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) most often have C-ANCA/PR3-ANCA, while those with microscopic polyangiitis have approximately an equal incidence of P-ANCA and C-ANCA.³²⁸ The potential triggers for ANCA production include immune dysregulation, molecular mimicry of microbial factors, and drugs such as propothiouracil, hydralazine, penicillamine, minocycline, and others. Genetic predisposition may play a role as evidenced by HLA class II associations, frequency of certain gene polymorphisms and presence of epigenetic alteration of MPO and PR3 surface expression.³³³ Approximately 10%–20% of pauci-immune glomerulonephritis patients lack ANCA, and other less frequent autoantibodies may have potential pathogenic role. 334,335 These include anti-LAMP2 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein-2), anti-moesin, and anti-plasminogen antibodies. Serum complement levels are typically normal in pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, but recent studies have highlighted the role of alternative complement pathway in the pathogenesis of this disease. 336 Cell mediated immune mechanisms also seem to play a role in the development of crescentic lesions.³²⁸

Immune-mediated nephritis is a common complication of SLE. The immune deposits in the kidney (and elsewhere) are derived from either circulating complexes or from an in situ combination of antigen and antibody.³⁴² Complement activation follows along with inflammatory response and organ damage. Immune-complex deposition is the most common form of glomerular injury, but immune deposits are absent in lupus-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and podocytopathies (such as MCD) and the injury in these settings is antibody mediated. It appears that the tubulointerstitial inflammation in SLE is more T-cell mediated.

Clinical evidence of renal involvement, as determined by urinalysis, or impaired renal function is seen in approximately 40%–80% of unselected patients with SLE. It is likely, however, that clinical assessment underestimates the actual frequency since histologic evidence of renal disease may be present even when the urinalysis is essentially normal. The clinical spectrum of lupus nephritis is wide, encompassing the acute nephritic syndrome, the nephrotic syndrome, acute and chronic renal failure, and isolated abnormalities in the urinary sediment. The most constant feature found in nearly all patients with clinical lupus nephritis is proteinuria. Microscopic hematuria is almost always present, but rarely does it develop in isolation; macroscopic hematuria is rare.

A kidney biopsy is essential in the renal assessment of patients with SLE and is indicated in all patients with abnormalities of urine sediment or renal function. In patients with these abnormalities, the clinical presentation does not accurately predict the disease.

The severity and the renal biopsy findings provide prognostic information and aid in the formulation of the treatment plan.

The pathologic findings of lupus nephritis are extremely diverse and may occur in all four renal compartments: glomeruli, tubules, interstitium, and blood vessels. This diversity may be the result of differences in the immune response in different patients or in the same individual over time. Standardized histologic classification of lupus nephritis developed by the International Society of Nephrology (ISN)/Renal Pathology Society (RPS) provides clear definitions for diagnostic categories based on quantitative assessment of individual histologic lesions. This classification has preserved some of the basic structure of earlier WHO classifications but has successfully eliminated some of the ambiguities that existed in the WHO classifications. The ISN/RPS classification defines six major classes (Table 23.5) and several published studies have shown a significant improvement in interobserver reproducibility and in predicting renal outcome when this classification is used.

As per the ISN/RPS classification, class I (minimal mesangial lupus nephritis) comprises those cases in which the glomeruli appear normal by light microscopy but show immune complex deposits by immunofluorescence and/or electron microscopy. Patients with class I nephritis usually manifest mild microscopic hematuria and/or mild proteinuria, and renal function is typically normal.

Class II (mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis) is defined by any degree of mesangial hypercellularity and/or mesangial matrix expansion as seen by light microscopy, accompanied by the demonstration of mesangial immune complex deposits by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The classification allows for the presence of rare minute subepithelial or subendothelial deposits identifiable only by electron microscopy or immunofluorescence, but not by light microscopy. Clinically, majority of patients have mild renal involvement as demonstrated by an inactive urine sediment. Less than 50% of the patients have mild hematuria and/or proteinuria.

Class III (focal lupus nephritis) is defined as focal segmental and/or global endocapillary, and/or extracapillary glomerulonephritis affecting less than 50% of the glomeruli. The biopsy may reveal a variable admixture of proliferative, necrotizing, and sclerosing lesions. The less affected glomeruli usually exhibit a diffuse mesangial prominence as seen in class II. The segmental proliferative lesions may be associated with leukocyte infiltration, fibrinoid material, and necrotic debris. Focal areas of necrosis containing fragmented nuclei known as hematoxylin bodies may be present. These structures are considered pathognomonic.

with focal capsular adhesions or the development of fibrous crescents. Despite the focal nature of the lesion by light microscopy, immunofluorescence generally reveals a more diffuse deposition of immunoglobulins and complement. Electron microscopy often demonstrates deposits in the mesangial and subendothelial regions, and, less frequently, in the subepithelial areas. In the ISN/RPS classification, III (A) refers to active lesions, III (C) refers to healed, chronic, inactive lesions, and III (A/C) indicates a combination of active and chronic lesions. The proportion of glomeruli affected by active or healed lesions should be included in the diagnostic report.

The clinical picture of patients with class III lupus nephritis is quite variable. Approximately half of the patients have active urinary sediment, and about 50% have proteinuria, which may be in the nephrotic range in up to one-third of the cases. Renal insufficiency is rather uncommon and occurs in 10%–25% of the patients.

Class IV (diffuse lupus nephritis) is defined as diffuse segmental and/or global endocapillary and/or extracapillary glomerulonephritis affecting 50% or more of the glomeruli included in the biopsy. The lesions in this class are identical to class III but tend to be diffuse and more global, and the immune complexes are more abundant. It has been suggested that classes III and IV lupus nephritis are ends of a pathologic continuum since the differences between these classes are quantitative rather than qualitative. The immune deposits in the subendothelial areas may produce marked thickening of the capillary walls to form the characteristic “wire loop” lesions (Fig. 23.50). On occasion, the capillary lumina can be occluded by massive deposition of immune complexes (“hyaline thrombi”).

Immunofluorescence studies often reveal more than one class of immunoglobulin in a coarse granular pattern in the mesangium and peripheral capillary walls in all glomeruli. IgG is almost invariably present, but IgM and IgA are also frequently found. Both C3 and C1q are frequently found and the staining for C1q is particularly strong. When all immunoglobulins and complement components are present, the pattern is often referred to as “full house,” an immunofluorescent profile seen in all lupus classes and is considered characteristic of lupus nephritis of lupus nephritis but are found in only 1%–2% of renal biopsies from these patients. They range considerably in size from minute fragments to round masses approximately the size of the nucleus and have a characteristic lilac tinge on H&#x26;E-stained sections.

Reactiveness for fibrin and fibrinogen are commonly seen in crescentic and necrotizing lesions. Electron microscopy demonstrates large subendothelial electron-dense deposits usually accompanied by mesangial and sometimes subepithelial and/or intramembranous deposits (Fig. 23.52A). Subendothelial deposits are primarily found in proliferative lupus nephritis (classes III and IV).

IV) and are considered to be a marker of activity. On occasion, electron-dense deposits may show a distinctive fingerprint-like crystalline pattern, possibly representing cryoglobulins (see Fig. 23.52B). This substructure, although nonspecific for lupus nephritis, are usually associated with class IV lesion. The endothelial cells may be swollen and contain tubuloreticular inclusions (see Fig. 23.52C). Studies have demonstrated that these myxovirus-like structures are inducible in vitro in normal lymphocytes on exposure to interferon alpha, earning them the descriptive term “interferon footprints.”

The ISN/RPS classification subdivides class IV lupus nephritis into those cases with diffuse segmental versus diffuse global proliferations. The designation IV-S is used if over 50% of the involved glomeruli exhibit segmental lesions; the designation of IV-G is used if over 50% of affected glomeruli show global lesions. This subdivision is rather arbitrary and of unclear significance but was included to further investigate possible differences in outcome and pathogenesis between these subgroups. The clinical symptoms in patients with class IV lesions are quite severe and may include nephrotic range proteinuria and active urine sediment. Without therapy, these patients are considered to have the worst prognosis since a high percentage progress rapidly to renal failure.

Class V (membranous lupus nephritis) is defined by the presence of global or segmental continuous subepithelial immune complex deposits or their morphologic sequelae by light microscopy. The membranous changes may occur alone or with a background of mesangial hypercellularity and mesangial immune complex deposits. Small subendothelial deposits can be identified by immunofluorescence or electron microscopy but not by light microscopy. The peripheral glomerular capillary walls often appear diffusely thickened (Fig. 23.53) and the so-called spike and dome pattern may be demonstrated on silver methenamine stain. By electron microscopy, the GBM shows the same ultrastructural stages seen in idiopathic MGN. However, in contrast to this condition, mesangial deposits are commonly found in membranous lupus nephritis patients. Virtually all patients have proteinuria at presentation, and 60%–70% have the nephrotic syndrome. About 50% of the patients have hematuria.

Class VI (advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis) is defined by global glomerulosclerosis affecting over 90% of the glomeruli without residual activity. In less advanced lesions, mesangial and endocapillary hypercellularity may be seen and small amounts of immune complex deposits can be detected by immunofluorescence or electron microscopy.

vascular immune deposits, noninflammatory necrotizing vasculopathy, true vasculitis with leukocyte infiltration and necrosis of the vessels walls, and TMA. All these vascular changes are signs of poor prognosis and, thus, should be recognized but are not currently included in histologic classification or activity and chronicity indices. 370

Some authors have proposed that histologic indices derived from the semiquantitative analysis of activity and chronicity in renal biopsies of patients with SLE have a prognostic value and can serve as a therapy guide.371 The activity index is calculated by the assessment of the following six histologic parameters: glomerular endocapillary proliferation, glomerular leukocyte infiltration, wire loop deposits and hyaline thrombi, glomerular fibrinoid necrosis and karyorrhexis, cellular crescents, and interstitial inflammation. The severity of each of these features is scored on a scale of 0 to 3+, and the fibrinoid necrosis/karyorrhexis and cellular crescents scores are doubled. Thus, the maximum activity score is 24. The chronicity index is computed by the sum of individual scores (0–3+) of the following four parameters: global glomerulosclerosis, fibrous crescents, TA, and IF.

Figure 23.53 Lupus Nephritis, ISN/RPS Class V. The capillary walls are thickened and the mesangial matrix is segmentally increased. Thus, the maximum chronicity score is 12. Although the validity and the reproducibility of activity and chronicity indices have been questioned,372 these indices help guide the management of individual cases as they provide useful information about the efficacy of therapy and the potential reversibility of the renal lesions.

microscopy in the mesangium and thickened capillary walls. Severe TA, IF, inflammation, and arteriosclerosis are usually present. Patients with class VI lesions often have significant proteinuria and severe renal insufficiency and are unlikely to respond to immunosuppressive therapy.

Although in the past the recurrence of lupus nephritis after renal transplantation was reported to be rare, affecting only 1%–4% of the allografts, more recent studies indicate that the recurrence rate is higher (ranging from 8% to 30%) than was previously believed.373–375

While most cases of lupus nephritis fall into the above categories, some overlap between classes exists. The most common involves classes III and V, and IV and V, and have been designated as combined classes III + V, and IV + V. The transformation of lupus nephritis lesions from one class to another is not uncommon over the course of the disease. It has been reported in 10%–50% of patients who undergo successive renal biopsies,360,361 and it has occurred between all morphologic types: focal to diffuse,362 focal to membranous, diffuse to membranous,363 membranous to diffuse proliferative, and membranous to membranous with focal proliferative lesions.361,364,365

Tubulointerstitial inflammation can be found in all classes of lupus nephritis, even in those with minimal glomerular lesions.360 Severe active TIN is most frequently seen in patients with classes III and IV lupus nephritis, is important in disease progression, and should be adequately assessed.366,367 In most instances, the interstitial inflammatory infiltrate is composed of mononuclear leukocytes, including lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasma cells, although neutrophils and eosinophils can sometimes be seen. In severe cases, there is inflammatory infiltration of the tubules and the tubular epithelial cells present degenerative and regenerative changes. Tubular casts made of neutrophils, erythrocytes, and shed tubular epithelial cells may be seen in the most severe cases. In about 50% of the patients, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy can demonstrate granular immune deposits along the peritubular capillaries, basement membranes of the proximal convoluted tubules, and interstitium (see Fig. 23.51). These deposits occur more frequently in diffuse lupus nephritis than in the focal variant but may also be found in patients with membranous and mesangial proliferative forms. Lupus nephritis is one of the few renal diseases in which immune deposits can be found not only in the glomeruli but also in the extraglomerular sites. The severity of the tubulointerstitial inflammation roughly correlates with the glomerular proliferative lesions; however, a few cases of severe tubulointerstitial damage without the significant glomerular disease leading to acute renal failure have been reported.368,369

Renal vascular lesions are relatively common in SLE and can assume a variety of morphologic forms, including uncomplicated.

# Glomerular Lesions Associated With Vascular Diseases

# Systemic Vasculitis

Vasculitis may occur in a variety of conditions, particularly in connective tissue diseases such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, and in hypersensitivity reactions caused by infections and drug reactions. Vasculitis may also occur as the primary manifestation of a variety of clinical conditions known as idiopathic systemic vasculitides. Clinical symptoms depend on the organ distribution, the size of the affected vessels, and the severity of the inflammation. The kidneys can be affected in different ways in systemic vasculitis. Large vessel vasculitides, such as giant cell (temporal) arteritis and Takayasu disease, can produce narrowing of the renal arteries, resulting in renal ischemia and hypertension. Medium-sized vessel vasculitides, such as polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and Kawasaki disease, can affect intrarenal arteries and cause infarction and hemorrhage, whereas in small vessel vasculitides, such as microscopic polyangiitis (previously microscopic polyarteritis), GPA (previously Wegener granulomatosis), eosinophilic GPA (previously Churg–Strauss syndrome), HSP, and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, the renal involvement is often manifested by glomerulonephritis.376

The vasculitides differ not only in their clinical and pathologic characteristics but also in their presumed pathogenesis. The large vessel vasculitides are supposedly caused by cell-mediated immune reactions to poorly defined (auto) antigens.377 Immune complexes are involved in the pathogenesis of some small vessel vasculitides, such as HSP and cryoglobulinemia, whereas vasculitic lesions associated with microscopic polyangiitis, GPA, and eosinophilic GPA lack immune complexes and because of this, are collectively designated pauci-immune necrotizing vasculitides. Pauci-immune vasculitides are characterized by the presence of ANCA, which are valuable serologic markers for the diagnosis and monitoring of this group of vasculitides.378,379 There is also evidence that ANCA are directly involved in the pathogenesis of these conditions.380,381

diseases in which vasculitis appears to be the primary histopathologic lesion will be discussed in this section.

# Polyarteritis Nodosa

PAN is a primary vasculitis of largely unknown etiology that affects muscular medium-sized arteries and produces lesions of varying stages (acute and healed) with aneurysm formation. The kidneys and gastrointestinal tract are among the organs most commonly affected, while the lungs are usually spared. The clinical manifestations are related to ischemia and disease severity of the involved organ. Peripheral neuropathy has been reported in approximately 75% of the cases. The estimated incidence is two to three cases per million. Males are affected twice as often as females, and the peak incidence is in the sixth decade of life. There is no serum marker for PAN and, by disease definition, there should be no glomerular or other capillary involvement in classic PAN. ANCA serology is typically negative unless there is a rare clinical overlap with microscopic polyangiitis. About one-third of the patients may be carriers of the hepatitis B virus. It has also been reported in hepatitis C and HIV-infected patients. Recently mutations in CECR1, a gene encoding adenosine deaminase 2, an adenosine inactivating extracellular enzyme, have been detected in familial form of PAN with autosomal recessive inheritance.

The kidneys are involved in 80%–90% of the cases. Renal infarctions occur frequently and may be manifested by loin pain and hematuria. Hypertension is common and may be severe or malignant. The renal lesion in PAN is a necrotizing vasculitis that involves medium-sized muscular arteries, such as the renal, interlobar, and arcuate arteries. The lesions are quite focal and tend to localize to the bifurcations, and weakening of the vessel wall leads to the formation of aneurysmal dilations, detectable on Doppler ultrasonography or CT angiography. The inflammatory process may involve part of or the entire vessel wall and is characterized by fibrinoid necrosis and leukocytic infiltration, sometimes associated with intraluminal thrombosis. The acute phase evolves into a healing phase in which the necrosis subsides and the leukocytic inflammation is replaced by mononuclear infiltrate. In the healed stage, there is fibrosis of the media and perivascular tissue, disruption of elastic lamina, and recanalization of the thrombosed vessels.

# Microscopic Polyangiitis

Microscopic polyangiitis, formerly known as microscopic polyarteritis, is a necrotizing systemic vasculitis with few or no immune complexes (pauci-immune) that affects small vessels (capillaries, venules, and arterioles). Involvement of small and rarely medium-sized arteries can also occur, but this is not a constant feature. Because of the absence of arterial involvement in many cases, and the frequent involvement of venules, arterioles, and capillaries (including glomeruli), the term microscopic polyangiitis is now considered more appropriate for this form of vasculitis than the designation of microscopic polyarteritis. Microscopic polyangiitis is distinct from PAN, is mediated by ANCA, and falls under the category of pauci-immune glomerulonephritis/vasculitis. The incidence of microscopic polyangiitis is approximately 1 per 100,000. Males are affected slightly more than females, and although it can occur at any age, it is more frequent during the sixth decade of life. Clinical manifestations are quite varied and nonspecific. Depending upon the organ(s) affected, the most common clinical features are hematuria and proteinuria, hemoptysis, palpable purpura, abdominal pain, myalgias, and arthralgias. Hypertension may occur, but it is usually mild.

In contrast to PAN, however, the lungs are commonly affected in microscopic polyangiitis. A frequent clinical presentation of microscopic polyangiitis is as pulmonary–renal syndrome. This syndrome raises the possibility of anti-GBM disease (Goodpasture syndrome); however, the demonstration of ANCA in microscopic polyangiitis or anti-GBM antibodies in anti-GBM disease will establish the correct diagnosis. Over 80% of patients have detectable ANCA, most often P-ANCA (and anti-MPO). In addition to ANCAs, a recent study suggested a pathogenic role for anti-moesin antibodies in MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis. In the kidney, the most frequent lesion is glomerulonephritis, and the glomerular involvement ranges from a focal and.

Rewrite the following pathology text into a more formal and comprehensive paragraph suitable for a pathology report. STATEMENT: segmental necrosis to a severe diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis (see Fig. 23.55).395,396 When present, necrotizing arteritis most often affects the interlobular arteries and rarely arcuate arteries.³⁹⁷ Histologically, vasculitis in microscopic polyangiitis may be indistinguishable from that seen in PAN. However, in contrast to the lesions seen in PAN, which are usually in varying stages of evolution, those in microscopic polyangiitis almost invariably appear to be temporally uniform; glomerular involvement indicates a diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis.³⁹⁸ A tubulointerstitial infiltrate including eosinophils is frequently present. Immune complex deposits are not usually seen in the glomeruli, though there have been reports of sparse deposits containing IgG or IgM with C3 in various intraglomerular locations.³⁹⁸

# Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis

GPA (previously known as Wegener granulomatosis) is a multisystem disease of unknown etiology characterized by the triad of: (1) necrotizing granulomatous inflammation involving the upper respiratory tract (ear, nose, throat, and sinuses) and/or lungs; (2) necrotizing vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels (capillaries, venules, arterioles, and arteries) most prominently in the lungs and upper airways but also involving other sites as well; and (3) renal disease, most often manifested in the form of focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis.³⁹⁹ Those patients who do not manifest the full triad are considered to have limited GPA. In these cases, involvement is limited to the respiratory tract and the kidneys are unaffected. The prevalence of GPA in the United States has been estimated to be 3 per 100,000,⁴⁰⁰ with slight male predominance. It may occur at any age, but it is more common in the fourth and fifth decades. 401 The first clinical indication is usually upper respiratory symptoms which are followed by systemic phenomena related to the vasculitis.⁴⁰² About 80%–85% of patients present some signs of renal involvement, usually simultaneously with other clinical features, 403 but fewer than 20% actually present with renal functional impairment. Patients with renal involvement, if untreated, usually have a rapidly progressive and fatal disease. Therapy with cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and corticosteroids produces remission in most patients, but up to 50% of the patients may relapse. 329,403

The differentiation of GPA from other types of vasculitis can be difficult clinically and morphologically. A positive ANCA test, especially C-ANCA (and/or PR3), can be extremely helpful in establishing or supporting the diagnosis of GPA. The specificity of C-ANCA in biopsy-proven GPA has been shown to be about 90%. The sensitivity depends upon the extent and activity of the disease. Although it has been shown that serum levels parallel the clinical activity of the disease 404 and that rising levels may be used as a predictor of relapse, there are some patients in whom C-ANCA titers do not follow disease activity. 401,403 The pathogenic role of ANCA with specificity to PR3 has been previously well established, 399 but recent studies have pointed to several pathways involving cell-mediated processes, neutrophil traps, and inflammatory mediators mediating tissue injury in GPA. 405

The most common renal lesion is focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis, often with crescents.⁴⁰⁶ Granulomatous glomerulonephritis occurs but it is uncommon, even in autopsy series, and is usually accompanied by necrosis of the hilar arterioles. 407 Necrotizing vasculitis involving the arterioles and small arteries occurs, but it is not a common finding in kidney biopsies. Interstitial inflammatory infiltrates are common, but necrotizing granulomata are rarely seen in renal biopsy specimens. 403

As a rule, immune complex deposits are absent in GPA by electron microscopy, though there have been reports of the occurrence of sparse electron-dense deposits at different sites in the glomerulus.406,408

# Glomerular Lesions Associated With Vascular Diseases

Immunofluorescence shows fibrinogen in glomeruli and the walls of involved vessels, and small amounts of IgM and/or IgG and C3 have been reported in glomeruli and vessels.

# Eosinophilic Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), also known as Churg–Strauss syndrome or allergic granulomatosis, is a rare disorder characterized by asthma, eosinophilia, and systemic vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels.409,410 The syndrome has no gender predilection, and while it has been reported in all ages, the mean age at diagnosis is approximately 50 years.411–414 Renal involvement can be seen in 50% or more of these patients. 411–413 Patients with EGPA often have elevated IgE levels in their serum, and ANCA positivity (P-ANCA and anti-MPO) has been reported in 40%–80% of the cases.414–416 In contrast to other vasculitides, renal involvement in EGPA rarely predominates. It is manifested by microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria and, less frequently, by the nephrotic syndrome or rapidly progressive renal failure. 411–414,417 The renal prognosis in EGPA is generally better than that of other pauci-immune vasculitides, such as GPA or microscopic polyangiitis. 417 Patients usually respond to high dose steroids, but cyclophosphamide and rituximab are effective in refractory cases. 418

The most common light microscopic abnormality on renal biopsy is that of a focal and segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescent formation similar to that found in other ANCA-associated vasculitides, with eosinophil-rich arteritis (a distinctive feature) in a minority of cases.419,420 The interstitium may be affected by inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Interstitial granulomas can also occur but are uncommon. Immunofluorescence studies may show positivity for IgM, C3, and fibrinogen in glomeruli in the segmental areas of necrosis. No immune complex deposits are found by electron microscopy.

# Henoch–Schönlein Purpura

HSP is a distinct systemic vasculitic syndrome that is characterized by palpable purpura (most often symmetrically distributed over the extensor-dependent surfaces of the lower extremities and buttocks), migratory arthralgias, abdominal manifestations (including pain, vomiting, and intestinal bleeding), and renal disease.421,422 The clinical manifestations of the syndrome are caused by a systemic small vessel vasculitis of the leukocytoclastic type. The inflammatory reaction seen in the skin, kidney, and other organs is caused by deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes. HSP can occur at any age but is more common in young children, with over 50% of the cases under 5 years and over 75% under 10 years.423,424 A male predominance has been reported in both children and adults, with a ratio of up to 2 422,423 : 1. HSP is uncommon in blacks, and familial cases have rarely been reported. 425 About one-fourth of the patients have a history of allergies. Renal involvement has been reported to occur in approximately 20%–55% of children 426,427 and 50%–85% of adults423,428 and ranges from mild hematuria and proteinuria with no reduction in renal function to the nephrotic syndrome and severe renal insufficiency. Upper respiratory tract infections often precede the onset of HSP. The disease undergoes complete, spontaneous remission in half of the patients, usually within a year of onset, but in many others, it progresses to ESRD over a period of 5–10 years. The prognosis in children is excellent with ESRD reportedly occurring in only 2% of patients. In general, there is good correlation between the severity of the lesion and the clinical manifestations, and patients with the nephrotic syndrome usually progress to renal failure. 428 Recurrence can occur in allografts, but it is rarely responsible for graft failure.

By light microscopy, the most characteristic feature is a mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with a variable degree of crescent formation. The mesangial changes, which may be focal or diffuse, include both mesangial hypercellularity and an increase in mesangial matrix. Occasional cases may show a membranoproliferative pattern. In the most severe cases, the glomerular tufts may be infiltrated by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear cells and may exhibit areas of necrosis. Vasculitis involving glomerular arterioles and interlobular arteries can also occur, but this is a rare finding on renal biopsies. Tubulointerstitial changes of atrophy and IF correlate with the degree of glomerular damage. Electron microscopy shows mesangial deposits that may extend into the subendothelial areas. Subepithelial deposits similar to those in membranous nephropathy or resembling the humps of postinfectious glomerulonephritis have been reported.⁴²⁹ But in such instances, a recently characterized entity, IgA-dominant postinfectious glomerulonephritis, associated with co-dominant C3 staining and frequent hypocomplementemia, should be considered.²³⁹ The most distinctive feature of HSP is the demonstration of dominant or co-dominant IgA by immunofluorescence. As in IgAN, the deposits may also contain IgG, IgM, C3, and properdin but not C1q or C4. The fact that the deposits consist mainly of aberrantly glycosylated polymeric IgA1 supports the notion that IgAN and HSP are spectra of the same disease. 311,430

# Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis

and pathologic features of type I cryoglobulinemia are identical to those of mixed cryoglobulinemia. 433 Hypocomplementemia is common, especially low C4, but several cases have reduced levels of C3 as well. False negative result for serum cryoglobulins is real concern, and appropriate sample collection and transportation to maintain the serum temperature at 37°C is extremely important. Three types of cryoglobulinemia are recognized: type I, in which the cryoglobulins are composed exclusively of a single monoclonal immunoglobulin of either IgG or IgM class, usually generated by a lymphoplasmacytic disorder, and types II and III, which are composed of “mixed” cryoglobulins, a designation based on their composition as complexes of immunoglobulins. Type II cryoglobulins consist of a complex of monoclonal immunoglobulins (typically IgM) with rheumatoid factor activity, causing it to bind to polyclonal IgG, whereas type III cryoglobulins are a mixture of polyclonal IgM and IgG. Mixed cryoglobulins (types II and III) can be found in the serum of patients with a variety of clinical conditions, including lymphoproliferative disorders, chronic infections, chronic liver disease, and autoimmune diseases, particularly SLE. 431 In the past, no clear cause could be found in about 30% of all mixed cryoglobulinemias (and so referred to as “essential” cryoglobulinemia), but it is now clear that the majority are associated with hepatitis C virus infection.⁴³² Approximately 10%–15% of all cases of cryoglobulinemia involve type I cryoglobulins, 50%–60% type II, and 25%–40% type III.178,432 Any of the three types of cryoglobulin can precipitate in the vasculature, forming thrombi in virtually any organ of the body, and may elicit an inflammatory reaction (vasculitis) in the vessel wall.433,434

A distinctive clinical syndrome characterized by a variable combination of fatigue, purpura, arthralgias, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, Raynaud phenomenon, and glomerulonephritis has been observed in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia. Both sexes are affected, though it is most common in women in the fourth and fifth decades.⁴³⁵ Purpura is almost always present and is usually distributed over the lower extremities. Renal disease occurs in about 50% of the patients and becomes apparent 1–3 years after the purpura, but it can be a presenting symptom.⁴³⁶ Typical clinical manifestations are nephrotic-range proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and hypertension. Acute nephritic syndrome occurs in 20%–30% of the cases, and oliguric acute renal failure in about 5% of patients with renal disease. Although rare, renal involvement can occur in type I cryoglobulinemia. In the few reported cases, the clinical manifestations of TMA constitute a group of microvascular occlusive disorders characterized by hemolytic anemia that is caused by fragmentation of erythrocytes, thrombocytopenia due to increased platelet aggregation, and thrombus formation that produces variable signs and symptoms of organ ischemia.⁴⁴⁰ In addition to schistocytes on peripheral smear, patients with TMA have elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, low.

bloody) followed by acute renal failure. About one-third of the patients may present symptoms of neurologic involvement, commonly manifested by seizures, altered consciousness, and focal neurologic signs. Because thrombotic changes are most often confined to the glomeruli, patients with classic HUS usually have a good prognosis and recovery occurs in about 80%–90% of the cases. About 5% of the patients, however, die of disease, usually of cerebral causes.

# D− HUS

D− HUS is much less common than the classic type and accounts for only 5%–10% of all cases of the disease. It may occur at any age but is more frequent in adults. The etiology of D− HUS is heterogeneous. It can be associated with nonenteric infections caused by bacteria, such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and Legionella or viruses, such as influenza A virus and HIV. Infection caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae* accounts for 40% of D− HUS and 4.7% of all cases of HUS in children in the United States. D– HUS can also occur in association with disorders such as SLE, systemic sclerosis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, malignant hypertension, or various forms of cancer, especially prostatic, gastric, breast, and pancreatic carcinomas. This form of HUS can be induced by total body irradiation, antineoplastic agents (mitomycin, cisplatin, bleomycin, and gemcitabine, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) or immunosuppressive drugs (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, sirolimus, and interferon), quinine, and oral contraceptives.

A severe form occurs in association with pregnancy, especially in the postpartum period. The overall prognosis of these patients is poor, with a high mortality rate from central nervous system disease or uncontrollable bleeding, and, if they survive, usually develop chronic renal failure.

Several forms of D− HUS are hereditary, involving complement regulatory proteins, factor H, factor B, C3, membrane cofactor protein (MCP or CD46), or factor I. Defects in these proteins as a result of mutations of the corresponding genes cause excessive alternative complement pathway activation that damages endothelial cells, leading to a prothrombotic stage and local accumulation of platelet–fibrin thrombi. Certain high-risk haplotypes have also been identified and might account for variability in penetrance among family members. It has also been proposed that environmental triggers such as infection, pregnancy, transplantation, oral contraceptive pills, and drugs act as a second hit, overwhelm the delicate complement “balance” in these patients, and precipitate atypical HUS in adult life. Low serum C3 levels in HUS may indicate a genetic component.

A biopsy taken early in the disease course shows fibrinoid necrosis, intimal and subintimal fibrin deposits with entrapped fragmented red cells, thrombosis, and endothelial cell proliferation in small arteries and arterioles. The glomeruli may be affected similarly, exhibit acute ischemic changes, or be infarcted. There is endothelial swelling with narrowing of the capillary lumina. The mesangium is expanded, and, in severe cases, mesangiolysis may occur. As the lesion progresses, there is an intense basophilic intimal thickening in the small arteries and arterioles which greatly restricts the vascular lumina. These mucoid intimal changes usually develop over several weeks, although they may be seen in very early phase of the disease. Aneurysmal dilation, accompanied by proliferation of some arterioles, particularly at the hilus of the glomerulus is a typical finding. Insidious presentation and chronic glomerular TMA lesions are characterized mainly by mesangiolysis and basement membrane irregularities and double contours.

Electron microscopy reveals the most characteristic feature of HUS: narrowing of the capillary lumen due to marked widening of the subendothelial space that is filled with a pale, finely particulated.

# Systemic Sclerosis

Systemic sclerosis, progressive systemic sclerosis, or systemic scleroderma are terms used to designate a connective tissue disorder of unknown etiology characterized by multiple organ system involvement. Although a rare disease, with a reported prevalence ranging from 3.1 to 20.8 per 100,000, systemic sclerosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Women are more commonly affected than men, with a ratio of approximately 3 : 1. It may occur at any age but is more common between the fourth and sixth decades of life. The pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis is not fully understood but most likely involves a complex interplay of excessive fibrosis, vascular abnormalities, and abnormalities in the immune system. Most patients are ANA positive, which is a rather nonspecific feature. Several other autoantibodies such as RNA polymerase III, antitopoisomerase-1, and anticentromere antibodies are specific markers of systemic sclerosis but are not clearly linked to the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis. The autoimmune mechanisms in these patients potentially target endothelial cells and fibroblasts. The downstream effects of this targeted injury include increased vascular permeability, endothelial apoptosis, and platelet aggregation, and increased matrix production mediated by fibroblast-derived TGF-β and reduced matrix degradation.

The clinical features of the disease are produced by differing combinations of excessive collagen deposition and vascular disease, the former causing deformation and morbidity, and the latter being the mechanism of most systemic complications. Diffuse form of the disease with widespread cutaneous fibrosis is frequently associated with severe organ involvement while a disease limited to the distal extremities has milder organ involvement. Raynaud syndrome, skin thickening, digital pulp atrophy (sclerodactyly), and telangiectasia are the primary clinical manifestations of systemic sclerosis. Musculoskeletal involvement includes periarticular, tendon, and nerve entrapment, flexion contractures, acral osteolysis, and myopathy. In the gastrointestinal tract, the disease can cause esophageal dysmotility and malabsorption. Pulmonary hypertension and IF, cardiomyopathy, and scleroderma renal crisis are the major causes of mortality. Renal involvement occurs in 60%–70% of the patients. Two clinical forms of renal involvement have been recognized: an acute and rapidly progressive form of renal failure often associated with malignant hypertension, systemic vasoconstriction.

Rewrite the following pathology text into a more formal and comprehensive paragraph suitable for a pathology report. STATEMENT: # Renal Diseases of Pregnancy

Renal disease may be initiated or exacerbated during pregnancy. Because of the extent and complexity of the topic and space limitations, only preeclampsia will be discussed here.

# Preeclampsia

Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-induced systemic syndrome characterized by new-onset hypertension, proteinuria, and edema that usually occurs after the 20th week of gestation. When the syndrome progresses to a convulsive stage, it is termed eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome refers to a subset of preeclampsia patients with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. Preeclampsia affects approximately 3%–5% of pregnancies worldwide. Most cases occur in primigravidas, with an incidence as high as 7.5%. Although the etiology of the syndrome remains unknown, recent studies have shown that a reduction of VEGF—caused by an excess circulating antiangiogenic factors, most notably soluble FMS-like tyrosinase kinase (sFlt1) and soluble endoglin, which are highly elevated during preeclampsia—plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome. Derived from placenta, sFlt1 serves as a receptor for VEGF. VEGF is important not only in angiogenesis but is also a critical factor for the maintenance and health of the fenestrated and sinusoidal endothelium found in the renal glomerulus, brain, and liver.

The changes in preeclampsia occur primarily in the glomeruli, which appear characteristically enlarged, swollen, and bloodless, with thickened capillary walls. The bloodless pattern is produced by an intense swelling and hypertrophy of the endothelial and, to a lesser extent, the mesangial cells (endotheliosis). Glomerular cellularity is usually normal or mildly increased. By electron microscopy, the capillary lumens appear narrow or obliterated by swollen endothelium, which often exhibits a loss of its normal fenestration. When mesangial cell hypertrophy is severe, the mesangium may become interposed between the endothelium and the basement membrane. Distinct strands of fibrin are present in translucent subendothelial zones containing loose fibrillar material. Immunoﬂuorescence studies have shown that the deposits in the glomeruli consist mainly of fibrinogen. Immunoglobulins, especially IgM, may on occasion be present due to nonspecific trapping in injured glomeruli. The afferent arterioles and their endothelial cells retain a normal appearance, which is striking in contrast to the swollen, vacuolated glomerular endothelial cells. Patients in whom preeclampsia nephropathy is superimposed on essential hypertension have hypertensive arterial and arteriolar changes in addition to the glomerular lesion.

Preeclampsia usually carries a good prognosis, and the changes in the glomerular capillaries disappear in a few weeks following delivery. Blood pressure falls to normal levels within a month. However, preeclampsia recurs in approximately 20% of subsequent pregnancies.

The clinical presentation of HELLP syndrome in a pregnant woman might indicate an underlying atypical HUS due to mutations in genes encoding alternative complement pathway components or circulating autoantibodies to complement factors. It is being recognized that pregnancy-related stress may serve as a trigger for precipitating atypical HUS in a genetically predisposed individual.

# Hereditary Glomerular Diseases

# Alport Syndrome

AS (also known as hereditary nephritis) is an inherited type IV collagen disorder of the basement membranes manifested by progressive nephritis associated with deafness and ocular abnormalities. In the United States, it accounts for 2.5% of children and 0.3% of adults with ESRD. Males are more commonly affected than females.

AS is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Approximately 85% of the patients have the X-linked dominant form of the syndrome resulting from mutations in the COL4A5 gene located at Xq22, which encodes the α5 chain of type IV collagen. Most of the remaining patients have autosomal recessive AS due to mutations in either the COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes, while only a minority of families exhibit the autosomal dominant disease that also arises from mutations in these genes. To date, over 800 different mutations have been identified in X-linked dominant AS by different groups of investigators in various parts of the world.

The disorder is usually manifested in children and young adults by recurrent microscopic or gross hematuria. Although proteinuria is usually mild, in advanced stages of the disease it can be in the nephrotic range. In males, the disease is usually progressive. In X-linked disease, the risk for males progressing to ESRD before the age of 40 is 90% compared with only 12% in females, and the location of the mutation appears to determine the age of onset of ESRD. In autosomal recessive AS, females are affected as severely and as early as males with X-linked disease. While patients with autosomal dominant disease show a great variability in their clinical course, this is generally milder than in males with X-linked AS.

Bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss is the most common extrarenal manifestation of AS, often occurring in childhood in males, with females being affected later in life. Hearing impairment is always accompanied by renal involvement, but there is no relationship between the severity of the hearing loss and renal disease. Ocular abnormalities occur in 15%–30% of patients and appear to be confined to juvenile kindreds.

The most specific finding of AS can only be seen by electron microscopic examination of the glomeruli. The typical lesion is thickening of the GBM with transformation of the lamina densa into multiple interwoven lamellae. The epithelial aspect of the basement membrane often has a scalloped appearance, whereas the endothelial surface is usually smooth. The typical lesion of the GBM occurs in most but not all patients with AS. Affected young males and heterozygous females of any age may only have attenuated GBM measuring as little as 100 nm or even less, representing the earliest manifestation of disease; the extent and severity of the multilamellation increases with age. Some authors have found a correlation between the percentage of the GBM having a splitting of the lamina densa and the degree of proteinuria in patients with AS, which suggests that the increased permeability of the GBM to protein is the functional consequence of the GBM alteration.

In biopsies taken in the early stage of the disease, the glomeruli appear normal or may show mild mesangial hypercellularity with minor thickening of the capillary walls. As the disease progresses, however, the glomeruli undergo segmental and global sclerosis. Tubulointerstitial changes appear relatively early, and consist of irregular areas of nonspecific sclerosis. The presence of interstitial foam cells in the absence of nephrotic-range proteinuria is a characteristic but nonspecific feature of AS.

a Approximately 10% of males with X-linked AS (attributable to missense and intron mutations) exhibit positive immunostaining of the renal basement membranes for the α3, α4, and α5 chains, and the epidermal basement membranes for the α5 chain.

b Approximately 30% of females with X-linked AS exhibit positive uninterrupted immunostaining (with reduced intensity in some) of the renal basement membranes for the α3, α4, and α5 chains, and the epidermal basement membranes for the α5 chain.

c Some patients with autosomal recessive AS exhibit positive immunostaining (but reduced intensity) of the renal basement membranes for the α3, α4, and α5 chains.

d Some patients with thin basement membrane disease exhibit reduced intensity staining of the glomerular basement membranes for the α3, α4, and α5 chains.

Modified from Kashtan CE. The nongenetic diagnosis of thin basement membrane nephropathy. Semin Nephrol. 2005;25:159–162.

Scattered deposits of IgM and C3 can sometimes be seen in partially sclerosed glomeruli. Staining for specific monoclonal antibodies directed against different subunits of type IV collagen has greatly facilitated the diagnosis of AS. Kidneys from individuals who are not affected by AS show strong continuous immunostaining with antibodies to the α3, α4, and α5 chains along the GBM, and the basement membrane of the Bowman capsule and the distal convoluted tubules. This reactivity is absent in male patients with X-linked AS. Skin biopsies examined by immunofluorescence can also be an important diagnostic tool since the α5 chain is expressed in the normal epidermal basement membrane but not in X-linked AS patients. Therefore, in male patients with a clinical and familial history suggestive of X-linked AS, skin examination for the α5 chain may obviate the necessity for a kidney biopsy. It should be borne in mind, however, that some affected males do retain the expression of the α5 chain in their basement membranes. A mosaic staining pattern (interrupted or segmentally weaker staining) for the α5 chain is frequently seen in the epidermal and renal basement membranes of heterozygous females with X-linked AS, reflective of random inactivation of X chromosome in females. While this finding is indicative of the carrier state, a normal result does not exclude heterozygosity.

# Thin Basement Membrane Nephropathy

The descriptive term TBMN is used to designate a hereditary renal disease that is characterized by the uniform thinning of the GBM and normal patient survival without deterioration of renal function. Benign familial hematuria is another designation that has also been used.

========================================

used for this condition; however, it is now considered inappropriate since it could embrace other pathologic entities, such as familial cases of IgAN, in which the prognosis is not always benign. Although TBMN has generally been considered an autosomal dominant hereditary condition, recent genetic studies indicate that it is a heterogeneous disease with some being related to mutations in the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes with autosomal recessive inheritance.495,496 It has been shown that patients with TBMN exhibiting these COL4A3 and COL4A4 mutations are in fact carriers of autosomal recessive AS, and thus TBMN falls within the spectrum of type IV collagen diseases.497,498 These findings further emphasize the importance of genetic testing in TBMN. 494

TBMN is the most common cause of persistent hematuria in children and adults, and although its true incidence is unknown, it has been estimated that it affects at least 1% of the population.499,500 Both sexes are equally affected, and even though it can manifest at any age, it is seldom reported after the age of 50 years. The onset of the hematuria is usually in childhood, and it is typically microscopic and persistent; however, on occasion, it may be macroscopic and recurrent. 499 Mild proteinuria is not uncommon, but heavy proteinuria in the nephrotic range is rare. Severe proteinuria likely represents a manifestation of a coexistent glomerular lesion, such as MCD, IgAN, focal glomerulosclerosis, or MGN. 501 In contrast to patients with AS, those with TBMN have only rarely been reported to exhibit extrarenal manifestations of AS. 499

Aside from finding erythrocytes in the Bowman space and renal tubules, renal biopsies appear normal by light microscopy.492,502 The diagnosis is made by the ultrastructural demonstration of a uniform thinning of the lamina densa of the GBM (Fig. 23.65). The overall width of the GBM is reduced to one-third or is ≤200 nm.492,498,502 On light microscopy, the visceral epithelial cells are enlarged and vacuolated, giving a honeycomb appearance to the glomeruli. Similar changes are seen in the parietal epithelium, and in endothelial and mesangial cells (Fig. 23.66). There is also prominent vacuolization in the distal convoluted tubules and loops of Henle, as well as in the arteries. The vacuoles in each of these locations are PAS negative. With increasing age, there is segmental and global glomerulosclerosis with interstitial scarring and nodular arteriolar hyalinosis. Electron microscopy demonstrates a massive accumulation of laminated.

# Fabry Disease

Fabry disease, also known as Anderson–Fabry disease and angio-keratoma corporis diffusum universalis, is an uncommon inherited.

inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of the affected cells. Each is surrounded by a single unit membrane and measures up to 5 μm in diameter. They are either round with a concentric myelin-like structure, or ovoid with parallel layers (“zebra” bodies) (Fig. 23.67). Similar inclusions are present outside of the glomeruli in the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, and in the tubular epithelium, especially those of the convoluted tubule and the loops of Henle. Although the ultrastructural pattern is almost diagnostic of the disease, similar inclusions are seen in other conditions such as chloroquine toxicity and I-cell disease507,508 and, hence the importance of clinical and biochemical correlation.

# Nail–Patella Syndrome

Nail–patella syndrome (NPS; also known as hereditary onycho-osteodysplasia) is an uncommon autosomal dominant disorder defined by the association of nail dysplasia, absent or hypoplastic patella, elbow dysplasia, iliac horns, open angle glaucoma, and nephropathy.⁵⁰⁹ It is caused by mutations of the LMX1B gene located on chromosome 9q34.1. T⁵¹⁰ The LMX1B gene encodes LIM homeodomain transcription factor expressed in podocytes and is crucial in limb development. The incidence of the syndrome has been estimated to be 1 per 50,000 live births. Nail dysplasia is the most constant feature of the syndrome and can be observed at birth, but nephropathy and glaucoma are the most relevant clinical manifestations. Renal involvement occurs in about 30%–50% of patients.511,512 Asymptomatic proteinuria is the most common event, but the nephrotic syndrome can occur and some patients progress to renal failure.⁵¹²

Light microscopy of the kidney shows nonspecific changes such as focal thickening of the glomerular capillary walls and FSGS. By electron microscopy, the GBM appears irregularly thickened and often exhibits electron-lucent areas, giving it the so-called moth-eaten appearance. Collagen-like fibers are seen in the electron-lucent areas and in the mesangium, further enhanced by phosphotungstic acid stain (Fig. 23.68). The LIM homeodomain transcription factor regulates the transcription of type IV collagen and podocyte proteins, thus contributing to these ultrastructural changes. No recurrences of the renal changes have been reported after transplantation.⁵¹³

# Collagen Type III Glomerulopathy

Collagen type III glomerulopathy (also known as collagenofibrotic glomerulopathy)⁵¹⁴ is an idiopathic glomerular disease that is characterized by the massive accumulation of atypical type III collagen fibrils within the mesangial matrix and subendothelial space and an increase in serum type III procollagen peptide levels. This type of collagen is absent in normal human kidneys. Although initially thought to be a clinical variant of NPS, it is now considered to be a separate clinicopathologic entity.⁵¹⁵ Collagen type III glomerulopathy occurs in both familial and sporadic forms, and the familial cases show an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.516–518 The disease affects both sexes equally and manifests during childhood. Children often present with increasing proteinuria leading to the nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, and progressive renal failure. 514,517 An important feature in these patients is that they may develop HUS,⁵¹⁷ and associated inherited factor H deficiency has been documented in the literature.⁵¹⁹ In adults, the disease is often sporadic and has a more indolent course.

Light microscopy shows a diffuse increase in the mesangial matrix and generalized widening of the glomerular capillary walls, sometimes associated with mesangial cell interposition. By electron microscopy, there is a large accumulation of fibrils in the subendothelial aspect of the GBM and in the mesangial matrix. These curvilinear fibrils have a distinctive transverse band periodicity of approximately 60 nm, characteristic of type III collagen. Conventional immunofluorescence studies are either negative or show nonspecific deposits of immunoglobulins, especially IgM and complement components. The most important diagnostic feature is the presence of strong mesangial and capillary loop reactivity with anticollagen type III antibodies. Type III collagen deposition can also be seen in other organs, including the liver, spleen, myocardium, and thyroid gland. 520,521

# Fibronectin Glomerulopathy

Fibronectin glomerulopathy is an autosomal dominant disease with age-related penetrance, characterized by massive fibronectin deposition in the glomeruli. 522–524 Both sexes are equally affected, and in approximately 40% of the patients, it is caused by mutations of the FN1 gene located on chromosome 2q34. 525 Clinically, the disease

========================================

Rewrite the following pathology text into a more formal and comprehensive paragraph suitable for a pathology report. STATEMENT: # 23 Kidney: Non-Neoplastic Diseases

usually manifests as proteinuria (often within the nephrotic range), microscopic hematuria, and the slow deterioration of renal function that occurs over a period of several years.

By light microscopy, the glomeruli appear enlarged and lobulated, with a minimal degree of hypercellularity. The most characteristic feature is a marked enlargement of the mesangium and subendothelial space, resulting from the deposition of a homogeneous PAS-positive, Congo red–negative material that, by electron microscopy, has a dense granular appearance. Intermixed within the deposits are focal filamentous structures measuring 12–16 nm in diameter. Immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence studies demonstrate strong positivity for fibronectin in the areas corresponding to the deposits, but immunoglobulins and complement deposition are absent or scant at best. The disease has been reported to recur after renal transplantation, and an underlying abnormality in the metabolism of circulating fibronectin is involved in the pathogenesis of this condition. The FN1 mutations detected thus far affect the heparin-binding domains of the fibronectin, causing conformational changes to the protein. It has been suggested that the mutant fibronectin deposited in the glomerulus results in defective endothelial spreading and podocyte cytoskeletal organization, contributing to the proteinuria.

Renal Transplant Pathology staining for C4d in peritubular capillaries supports the diagnosis, but poor perfusion and tissue necrosis often precludes demonstration of C4d deposition. Electron microscopy shows platelets, fibrin, sludged red blood cells, and evidence of necrosis of the endothelial cells of glomerular capillaries and other vessels.

# Acute Rejection

Acute rejection, despite its name, can occur at any time during the post-transplantation period. It is most often seen in the months following implantation and becomes less common after the first year. Allograft Rejection is classified as hyperacute, acute, and chronic. Hyperacute rejection is antibody-mediated, while acute and chronic rejections can be either T-cell mediated (cellular rejection) or antibody mediated (humoral).

AMR is caused by anti-donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) directed against graft endothelium in glomeruli and peritubular capillaries. The target antigens are HLA class I and II molecules and in ABO-incompatible grafts, ABO antigens. Less common endothelial cell–specific antigens, angiotensin II type I receptor, and other non-MHC antigens have also been implicated. Early on, these pathogenic DSAs are preformed in recipient circulation (resulting in positive cross match) but late post-transplant acute AMR is caused by de novo DSA. The histologic features of acute AMR are mainly in glomeruli, peritubular capillaries, and arteries. The glomeruli show endothelial cell swelling, an increase in cellularity, and occasional fibrin thrombi. The peritubular capillaries are dilated with intra-luminal cells, referred to as “peritubular capillaritis.” Neutrophils and monocytes predominate the glomerular and peritubular capillary infiltrate. The arteries (and arterioles) may show endothelialitis or fibrinoid necrosis. Interstitial hemorrhage, tubular necrosis, and infarction are also seen, but interstitial inflammation and tubulitis are not predominant features unless combined with T cell–mediated rejection. On occasion, the histology of acute AMR is limited to acute tubular injury alone. Electron microscopy demonstrates endothelial cell swelling associated with separation of the endothelium from the basement membrane by fluffy fibrillar material, which occasionally contains fibrin strands and platelet fragments. The immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical demonstration of C4d deposition in graft peritubular capillaries is a durable and reliable marker of AMR, circulating anti-donor antibodies, and poor graft survival.

Prompting further study of C4d-negative AMR. AMR is not steroid responsive, and treatment modalities have included plasmapheresis, IV immunoglobulin, rituximab, and more recently, complement inhibition.

In the early stages of acute T cell–mediated rejection, light microscopy reveals edema and focal infiltration of the interstitium by lymphocytes (Fig. 23.73). As the rejection progresses, the inflammatory infiltrate becomes more diffuse and the lymphocytes, many of them immunoblasts, are accompanied by plasma cells, monocytes, and macrophages. Granulocytes may be present, but they are not numerous. When they are abundant, the possibility of AMR or pyelonephritis should be considered. Eosinophils can also be present but rarely in large numbers.

A characteristic finding in acute T cell–mediated rejection is invasion of the tubular epithelial cells by lymphocytes, a feature referred to as tubulitis. Tubulitis has been regarded as a reliable marker for acute rejection even though it can be seen in other forms of interstitial nephritis. The intensity of the infiltrate and tubular injury are features often used to grade the rejection. The infiltrate is more concentrated in the cortex than in the renal medulla. Immunophenotyping shows that most of the...

# Chronic Rejection

Chronic rejection occurs anywhere from several months to several years after transplantation and, once initiated, can be progressive and irreversible. It constitutes the most common cause of graft failure after the initial 6–12 months post transplantation. Chronic rejection is not a distinct entity but rather the end stage of repeated episodes of acute antibody- and/or T cell–mediated rejection. In addition, long-term administration of CsA or tacrolimus probably contributes to the development of some of the changes seen in chronic rejection.

Clinically, there is a gradual decrease in renal function. The deterioration may be preceded by proteinuria, sometimes nephrotic range, and is commonly associated with hypertension. Microscopically, the changes can be seen in glomeruli, arteries, and tubulointerstitium. Nonspecific features of TA and IF may be accompanied by features of underlying T cell–mediated rejection such as interstitial inflammation and tubulitis in nonatrophic cortex. The blood vessels, especially the interlobular and arcuate arteries, show severe obliterative fibrointimal proliferation or mucoid widening of the intima, referred to as chronic transplant arteriopathy. Fibrosis of the media and intimal foam cells may be seen, but reduplication of the elastic lamina is typically a feature of hypertensive arteriosclerosis. The distribution of the vascular lesions is irregular and some blood vessels appear normal while others present lesions of variable degrees of severity. The glomerular lesions consist of ischemic glomerular capillary collapse, and segmental and global sclerosis. While these changes described may be present in T cell– or antibody-mediated alloimmune injury, the hallmarks of chronic AMR are transplant glomerulopathy and peritubular capillaropathy. Reflective of repeated insults to the glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelium, this histologic evidence of chronic AMR is often accompanied by positive C4d stain in peritubular capillaries and circulating DSA.

Mononuclear cells may infiltrate beneath the endothelium of arteries or arterioles, and it signifies early vascular rejection. The cells are typically CD3 + T cells or CD68 + monocytes/macrophages. Associated swelling and vacuolization of vascular endothelial cells are often present, and the adjacent smooth muscle cells may show vacuolization caused by dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum. The intimal changes can be accompanied by either thrombosis or intimal proliferation. Thromboses are often small and nonocclusive, but in those cases progressing to irreversible rejection, they become obliterative and widespread with transmural necrosis of the vessel walls. Milder forms of intimal arteritis are often considered T-cell mediated, while AMR likely mediates most cases of transmural arteritis. Endarteritis is usually present in the background of severe tubulointerstitial inflammation. On occasion, it is observed with little or no interstitial inflammation (isolated endarteritis), and recent data suggest these cases mimic the behavior and survival of T cell–mediated tubulointerstitial and vascular rejection.

# The Banff Classification

To help establish uniform therapeutic guidelines for clinical management and to provide an objective evaluation of clinical trials of new antirejection agents, several classification systems for the evaluation of the histologic appearance of renal allograft biopsies have been developed over the past several decades. The best known of these is the Banff Working Classification of Renal Allograft Pathology, which was formulated by an international group of renal pathologists, nephrologists, and transplant surgeons who met in Banff, Canada, in August, 1991, and which was first published in 1993. Since its introduction, this classification has undergone several revisions, the latest of which was published in 2014.

Per Banff classification, there are six diagnostic categories: normal, AMR, borderline changes, T cell–mediated rejection, IF and TA without evidence of any specific etiology, and other changes not considered.

The details of the current Banff classification are shown in Box 23.6. In this classification, an adequate core biopsy must contain a minimum of 10 glomeruli and at least two arteries; a marginal sample is that with 7–10 glomeruli and one artery; and an unsatisfactory biopsy is a core with fewer than 7 glomeruli or no arteries.

Cyclosporine A (Cyclosporin) Toxicity

CsA is an immunosuppressant drug that belongs to the calcineurin inhibitors group which selectively targets IL-2–dependent T-cell proliferation. It is extremely effective in controlling transplant rejection; unfortunately, however, it is nephrotoxic. Other CsA-related toxicities include hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, gingival hyperplasia, hypertrichosis, and malignancies, particularly lymphomas.

Nephrotoxicity can occur not only in patients receiving renal transplants but also in those receiving the drug for any other reason. CsA nephrotoxicity is dose related and has been classified into functional toxicity in which there are no structural changes and morphologic forms in which the toxicity is manifested by a variety of lesions affecting tubules, vessels, and renal interstitium. Three major morphologic forms are recognized: acute nephrotoxicity, chronic nephrotoxicity, and TMA.

Functional Toxicity

Functional CsA toxicity probably affects every patient who receives this medication. A mild decrease in renal function and a mild elevation of serum creatinine levels are seen soon after therapy starts, but both are reversible if the dosage is reduced. Hypertension is seen in up to 50% of the patients. Renal biopsies in these patients appear normal or at most show some dilation and congestion of.

Figure 23.75 Transplant Glomerulitis and Glomerulopathy. The glomerulus shows increased intraluminal mononuclear inflammatory cells, consistent with transplant glomerulitis. The glomerular basement membrane double contours are a feature of chronic rejection (PAS).

Figure 23.76 Prominent Interstitial Lymphoplasmacytic Inflammation in Polyomavirus Nephropathy. A few tubular nuclei are enlarged with fine chromatin. The presence of viral inclusions is confirmed on immunohistochemical stain (anti-SV40) as seen in the inset.

The pathogenesis is an alteration of intrarenal hemodynamics that results from the ability of CsA to induce intense renal vasoconstriction.

# Acute Toxicity

The clinical manifestations of acute CsA toxicity are similar to that seen in functional toxicity, but tend to be more severe. Genetic factors seem to account for dose-independent susceptibility to acute toxicity in an individual. Histologically, the lesion is characterized by vacuolization of the proximal tubules, often in an isometric pattern, with giant mitochondria, large lysosomes, and microcalcifications. Electron microscopic studies have demonstrated that the vacuolization is the result of dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum.

In addition, the arterioles may show individual medial smooth-muscle cell degeneration, necrosis/apoptosis and myocyte drop-out, endothelial cell swelling, intimal thickening, and mucoid medial edema, which together may result in significant narrowing of the vascular lumina. Acute nephrotoxicity is usually dose dependent and reversible.

# Tacrolimus (FK506) Toxicity

Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant drug that is also used in the control of transplant rejection. The morphologic changes associated with tacrolimus toxicity are identical to those of CsA toxicity. These changes include vacuolization of the straight and convoluted portion of the proximal tubules, myocyte vacuolization, peritubular calcifications, TMA, arteriolar hyalinosis, and IF.

# Polyomavirus Nephropathy

The human polyoma virus type I has surfaced as a significant pathogen in kidney transplant recipients, causing polyomavirus nephropathy. Approximately 85% of polyomavirus nephropathy is attributed to BK virus, with the remainder caused by JC virus. BK virus reactivation occurs in 10%–60% of renal transplants and 1%–5% of renal allografts develop BK nephropathy. High-risk patients are monitored by serial measurements of urine and plasma polyoma viral loads. A plasma level of 104 virions/mL is considered highly specific (but significantly less sensitive) for polyomavirus nephropathy. The typical presentation is impaired renal function that is resistant to immunosuppressive therapy. The definite diagnosis of polyomavirus nephropathy requires the histologic demonstration of polyomavirus. The interstitium usually is infiltrated by mononuclear inflammatory cells, mimicking the changes seen in acute rejection. Renal tubular epithelial cells typically show enlarged nuclei with amorphous basophilic viral inclusions. Immunohistochemical stains can be helpful in assisting in the demonstration of the infected cells (Fig. 23.76). The immunostains can either be directed specifically to BK and JC virus or can be for SV40, another polyomavirus that has a shared large T antigen. Treatment of polyomavirus nephropathy primarily includes reduced immunosuppression. A coexistent acute rejection poses a diagnostic challenge, and the presence of endarteritis confirms the presence of acute rejection.

Rewrite the following pathology text into a more formal and comprehensive paragraph suitable for a pathology report. STATEMENT: Tubulointerstitial Diseases

Tubulointerstitial disease is a generic term used to designate a heterogeneous group of disorders that primarily affect the renal interstitium and tubules and only secondarily involves the other structures of the kidney. The frequency with which tubulointerstitial diseases affect the kidney is difficult to determine; however, it is believed that primary tubulointerstitial disease is the cause of renal failure in an estimated 20%–40% of all patients undergoing treatment for ESRD. The clinical presentations are usually very similar, but the etiologies are quite different and include infection, obstruction, and immune-mediated and toxic-tubulointerstitial diseases (Box 23.7). The functional manifestations include impaired concentrating ability, impaired ability to secrete acid, diminished reabsorption of sodium, hyperkalemia, and azotemia. Symptoms may be acute or chronic with corresponding morphologic changes.

# Acute Tubular Necrosis

ATN is a clinicopathologic syndrome that is characterized by the acute suppression of renal function accompanied by morphologic evidence of tubular epithelial cell injury. Two subtypes of ATN have been recognized: ischemic and toxic.

The ischemic form of ATN is the most common and results from hypoperfusion of the kidney. It is usually associated with hypotension that occurs in a wide variety of conditions such as severe traumatic lesions and burns, shock after a surgical operation, septic shock, pancreatitis, and dehydration after diarrhea, vomiting, or extensive sweating.

The less common nephrotoxic form is a chemically induced injury of the tubular epithelial cells that can be caused by a wide variety of substances, including organic solvents (e.g., carbon tetrachloride, ethylene glycol), heavy metals (e.g., mercury, lead), drugs such as antibiotics (e.g., amphotericin B, gentamicin), antivirals (tenofovir, acyclovir, indinavir), chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., methotrexate, cisplatin), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, calcineurin inhibitors, and radiographic contrast agents. Hemoglobin and myoglobin are considered endogenous toxins capable of causing ATN when present in urine in high concentrations. Hemoglobinuria can be due to incompatible blood transfusion, malaria, and paroxysmal hemoglobinuria. Myoglobinuric acute renal failure can be caused by the liberation of myoglobin from muscles caused by trauma (crush injury), myositis, ischemia, excessive exertion, or exposure to toxins (snake venom, alcohol, cocaine). It is believed that, while the toxicity of the hemoglobin and myoglobin may contribute to the pathogenesis of ATN, ischemia and microcirculatory disturbances probably play a greater role in its development.

Clinically, ATN is manifested by rapidly increasing serum creatinine levels associated with oliguria or anuria. Less frequently, ATN induces nonoliguric renal failure. Urinalysis typically demonstrates sloughed degenerated epithelial cells and granular casts. The clinical course of ATN is highly variable, and the prognosis largely depends on the clinical setting in which it occurs.

The morphologic changes in ischemic ATN depend on the severity of the renal failure and the evolution of the lesion. In early stages, the cellular changes can range from minimal cell swelling to individual cell necrosis accompanied by focal denudation of the basement membrane and desquamation of the necrotic cells into the tubular lumen. The proximal tubules may appear dilated and their PAS-positive brush border thinned or absent. Hyaline, granular, and pigmented casts are common, especially in the distal and collecting ducts. These casts consist mainly of Tamm–Horsfall protein mixed with cellular necrotic debris. Other findings in ischemic ATN are interstitial edema and the accumulation of mononuclear leukocytes within the vasa recta of the outer medulla. As the disease progresses after the initial injury, evidence of tubular regeneration can be seen. Changes that are believed to represent regeneration include flattened epithelium with dilation of the tubular lumen, the presence of large nuclei with prominent nucleoli, and mitotic activity.

Toxic ATN is characterized by extensive necrosis of the tubular cells along segments of the proximal tubule. Depending on the type of poisoning, several patterns of injury have been recognized.

# Acute and Chronic Pyelonephritis

Infectious TIN is generally designated as pyelonephritis, implying that the inflammatory process involves the collecting system, as well as the renal parenchyma.⁵⁷⁰ There are three peaks of incidence: infancy and early childhood, women of childbearing age, and both men and women older than 60 years of age. Both acute and chronic pyelonephritis are frequently associated with congenital or acquired obstructive lesions of the lower urinary tract or are associated with conditions resulting in residual retention of urine in the bladder.

Congenital lesions are often the cause of pyelonephritis in infancy and early childhood. In older adults, obstruction by nodular hyperplasia of the prostate gland in men and the development of cystoceles in women are important etiologic factors. In addition, conditions such as cancer of the cervix and nephrolithiasis are also commonly associated with renal infection.

Acute pyelonephritis is most often associated with an ascending infection and the acute inflammatory infiltrate involves the renal medulla and cortex (Fig. 23.78). The inflammatory cells are mostly polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and they are present in the interstitium and within the tubular lumina. Foci of necrosis and abscess formation can also be present in the cortex. The kidney can occasionally be infected by organisms arriving via the hematogenous route, resulting in the formation of many small cortical abscesses with little involvement of the medulla. Special stains may reveal the responsible pathogens. The ascending infections are caused by the normal gram-negative flora of the intestinal tract. By far the most common is Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella and Enterobacter. S. aureus or fungal organisms, including Candida and Aspergillus, may be the cause of hematogenous infections, and they are seen more often in immunosuppressed individuals.

Recent studies have suggested that kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) can be a useful immunohistochemical marker that can assist in the histopathologic diagnosis of tubular injury. KIM-1 is an immunoglobulin superfamily cell-surface protein that is undetectable in normal kidney but is highly overexpressed in proximal tubule cells after ischemic or nephrotoxic acute renal injury. 564,565 KIM-1 is a sensitive and specific early indicator of proximal tubular injury and can be detected in the urine and blood of individuals with acute renal injury. 566–568 Acute kidney injury can lead to chronic kidney disease and a progression to end-stage kidney disease especially in the presence of other predisposing factors or preexisting chronic kidney disease.⁵⁶⁹

Figure 23.79 Nephrectomy Specimen From a Patient With Obstructive Hydronephrosis. There is interstitial scarring with intense mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration. The tubules are atrophic, and the glomeruli are relatively spared with periglomerular fibrosis. Tamm–Horsfall protein can be identified in the interstitium as small bodies of amorphous fibrillary material that are strongly PAS positive and surrounded by inflammatory cells. The glomeruli are not primarily involved, but they can be initially affected by periglomerular fibrosis (see Fig. 23.79). Ischemic changes consisting of focal and segmental sclerosis and hyalinosis may also occur.

The histopathologic changes associated with chronic pyelonephritis have also been described in vesicoureteral reflux and chronic urinary obstruction.571 An extreme form of localized scarring is seen in the so-called Ask–Upmark kidney, where total fibrosis of a lobule produces an appearance of segmental hypoplasia.

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is an uncommon and distinct type of chronic infectious pyelonephritis in which yellow, lobulated masses diffusely replace the renal architecture.572 There are cases in which only a portion of the kidney, such as one pole, is involved. The condition is usually unilateral, although rare bilateral cases have been reported. This disease can occur at any age: it has been reported in patients as young as 11 months to as old as 89 years but is more common in adults in the fifth through the seventh decades.570,573 It is twice as common in women as in men.570,574

Urinary obstruction is almost invariably present and is most often caused by stones. Other causes of obstruction include postradiation strictures, congenital pelviureteric stenosis, and tumors.575 The mass-occupying nature of this lesion frequently mimics that of a renal cell carcinoma and can result in unnecessary nephrectomies. A correct preoperative diagnosis is rarely made. Microscopically, there is a diffuse granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate that includes large numbers of foamy histiocytes and some multinucleated giant cells, as well as lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils (Fig. 23.80).576

If renal cell carcinoma is suspected, the presence of histiocytes in xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis can be confirmed on CD163 immunostain and the lack of infiltrating carcinoma can be demonstrated by the absence of cytokeratin expression. (Fig. 23.81). Ultrastructurally, these bodies are round with a core of concentric membranes, amorphous material or foci of calcification, and are highlighted on PAS stain (see Figs. 23.81 inset, and 23.82).579

The pathogenesis of this cellular accumulation is unknown, but there is evidence that the lesions result from a defective macrophage function that compromises the lysosomal degradation of engulfed bacteria and overloads the cytoplasm with undigested cellular debris.580

as fever, weight loss, and anorexia can occur, usually in adolescent and young adult women.⁵⁹⁰ Renal presentation of mild proteinuria and Fanconi syndrome is typical and the etiology is unclear. Interstitial granulomas can be present in a minority of these cases and potential etiologic factors include autoimmune, genetic, and infections such as Mycoplasma, Klebsiella, Toxoplasma, EBV, and herpes zoster.

# Acute Allergic Tubulointerstitial Nephritis

Many drugs, including β-lactam antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, and diverse other substances, can be responsible for acute TIN. 581–583 According to a series, omeprazole, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin are the most common offenders. 584 The clinical presentation is quite variable, but fevers and azotemia are common, and eosinophilia occurs in a majority of cases. Microscopic hematuria is not uncommon. A skin rash, usually described as maculopapular, is sometimes seen. Urinalysis reveals hematuria, sterile pyuria, and moderate proteinuria, and eosinophils may be detected in the sediment.⁵⁸⁵ Acute interstitial nephritis combined with MCD producing nephrotic-range proteinuria has been described with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 586

Light microscopy reveals generalized interstitial edema and infiltration of the interstitium by lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, and eosinophils (Fig. 23.83). 587 Damage to tubular epithelial cells with evidence of regeneration is always found, and lymphocytes may be seen infiltrating the epithelium. The glomeruli and vessels are not usually involved. Occasionally, ill-formed granulomas with giant cells can be seen with some drugs and in that setting, the differential diagnosis includes sarcoidosis, infections, and GPA. 588

Although bacterial infection and drugs are the most common causes of acute interstitial nephritis, a similar picture can be found in patients with autoimmune or immunologic disease such as SLE, Sjögren syndrome, IgG4-related TIN, TIN with uveitis, or, rarely, in association with antitubular basement membrane antibodies.⁵⁸⁹ The clinical and pathologic findings are parallel to those seen in allergic TIN. Although the renal disease in SLE predominantly affects glomeruli, coexistent interstitial inflammation is common and, on rare occasion, TIN exists in isolation. Sjögren’s syndrome-related TIN is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and associated glomerular disease is uncommon. The clinical presentation, extrarenal manifestations, and serologic studies are helpful in the diagnosis of SLE and Sjögren’s syndrome. In both diseases, the tubular basement membrane and interstitial deposits, when present, stain for IgG and C3 and, in the case of SLE, can show a full-house pattern.

A syndrome of acute TIN with anterior uveitis and constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and anorexia can occur, usually in adolescent and young adult women.⁵⁹⁰ Renal presentation of mild proteinuria and Fanconi syndrome is typical and the etiology is unclear. Interstitial granulomas can be present in a minority of these cases and potential etiologic factors include autoimmune, genetic, and infections such as Mycoplasma, Klebsiella, Toxoplasma, EBV, and herpes zoster.

# IgG4–Related Tubulointerstitial Nephritis

IgG4-related disease is a systemic fibroinflammatory disease, and the kidney involvement is characterized by polyclonal plasma cell–rich interstitial inflammation.⁵⁹¹ The frequent clinical presentation of IgG4-related TIN is chronic renal insufficiency and proteinuria that is typically mild unless the patient has glomerular involvement resulting in nephrotic syndrome. The presence of hypergammaglobulinemia and elevated serum IgG and IgG4 levels supports the diagnosis and approximately 50% of the patients have hypocomplementemia. Serum ANA is occasionally positive, and peripheral eosinophilia may be present. Imaging studies can reveal low attenuation cortical mass–like lesions, corresponding to patchy fibroinflammatory process.

The plasma cell–rich interstitial infiltrate frequently alternates with paucicellular fibrotic areas, especially with increasing chronicity. The dense IF has a characteristic storiform pattern. The presence of greater than 10 IgG4+ cells/40× field, although not entirely specific, meets the criteria for renal IgG4-related TIN (Fig. 23.84). 592 Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy reveal tubular basement membrane deposits in greater than 80% of cases and these are IgG, C3, κ and λ positive. It should be noted that plasma cell–rich and IgG4 cell–rich infiltrate can be observed in a variety of lesions such as chronic pyelonephritis and vasculitis-associated tubulointerstitial inflammation. The accurate diagnosis of IgG4-related TIN rests on evidence of systemic disease either in the form of elevated IgG4 levels or extrarenal disease. 592 Glomerular involvement is seen in less than 10% of IgG4-related TIN, often represented by a secondary membranous nephropathy with the deposits being PLA2R negative. 593

# Heavy Metals Nephrotoxicity

Renal damage can result from environmental or occupational exposure to heavy metals, such as lead, cadmium, mercury, uranium, chromium, copper, and arsenic, or the administration of therapeutic forms of platinum, gold, and bismuth. Due to its rather characteristic morphologic features and clinical importance, only the changes in the kidney produced by lead exposure will be discussed.

# Lead Nephropathy

Lead poisoning may be the result of occupational or environmental exposure. Workers at risk include electric storage battery makers, painters, welders, foundrymen, and jewelers. Children may be exposed by eating flaking lead paint. Inadvertent ingestion of lead can occur from drinking water contaminated by lead pipes, earthenware, or from adulterated wine or moonshine liquor. Lead is also present as an atmospheric contaminant resulting from the use of lead-containing gasoline and various industrial processes. Associated with chronic kidney disease, it can often go unrecognized in the modern era.

An important association in analgesic nephropathy is the increased risk for developing transitional cell carcinoma.

The most striking morphologic changes in lead exposure occur in the tubules and consist of eosinophilic intranuclear or cytoplasmic acid-fast inclusions that stain red with Giemsa stain. These inclusions consist of a lead–protein complex that by electron microscopy appear as compact cores surrounded by a loose meshwork of fibrils. They may be seen in tubular epithelial cells in urinary sediment during acute poisoning. Lead-containing inclusions have also been found in the liver and neural tissue.

Renal biopsies in chronic lead nephropathy often show tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis with minimal inflammatory reaction. Arteriolar changes reminiscent of hypertensive nephrosclerosis may be present even in the absence of hypertension. The inclusions are often absent when the disease is longstanding or after the administration of chelating agents.

# Nephrolithiasis and Nephrocalcinosis

Nephrolithiasis is a common disorder defined as the development and accumulation of stones within the collecting system of the kidney.

The estimated incidence in the United States ranges from 7 to 21 cases per 10,000 population.⁶¹³ Men are affected approximately four times more frequently than women, and the predominant age at onset is in the third to fifth decades. The most characteristic symptoms of nephrolithiasis are pain and hematuria. The classic pain is that of severe, abrupt, flank pain (renal colic) that only resolves after the passage or removal of the stone. The hematuria can be gross or microscopic and most commonly occurs with large calculi during infection or colic. About 75% of the stones are composed of a combination of calcium oxalate or calcium oxalate mixed with calcium phosphate; 15% are the so-called struvite stones that are composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate and are often associated with urea-splitting bacterial infections; 6%–10% consist of uric acid; and 1%–2% of cystine. Renal stones within the pelvic calyceal system can cause gross and microscopic changes in the renal parenchyma that are identical to those seen in pyelonephritis and hydronephrosis.

The presence of calcium within the renal parenchyma is known as nephrocalcinosis.⁶¹⁴ Calcium deposition occurs on tubular basement membranes and in the interstitium. TA, IF, and periglomerular fibrosis are also present. Some of the glomeruli may be sclerosed. Several systemic disorders are associated with nephrocalcinosis and the formation of stones. Calcium phosphate and oxalate stones occur in hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, milk–alkali syndrome, excessive dietary intake of vitamin D, multiple myeloma, and renal tubular acidosis. Abundant intratubular calcium phosphate deposition can occur in patients who receive oral sodium phosphate bowel purgative prior to colonoscopy. Referred to as acute phosphate nephropathy, it is often associated with inadequate hydration and concomitant use of diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers. Renal insufficiency occurs weeks or months after the colonoscopy was performed.⁶¹⁵

Uric acid stone formation takes place in an acid urine in the presence of hyperuricosuria, which may result from an inborn error of metabolism such as gout or the Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, glycogen storage disease following treatment of hematopoietic malignancies, overindulgence in dietary proteins, or the use of uricosuric drugs.⁶¹⁶ Uric acid stones are usually radiolucent, and because they are often small they may be passed, but larger ones in the renal pelvis can grow and become staghorn calculi. Uric acid crystals are also deposited within the renal parenchyma, and they can be seen within the collecting tubules as elongated or rectangular crystals or as doubly refractile crystals in the interstitium surrounded by a giant cell reaction.617,618

A clinical sign of cystinuria is calculi in the urinary tract. The stones are formed in acid urine. They are typically yellow–brown and radiopaque. Cystine crystals appear as microscopic, flat hexagons in the urine, and this feature constitutes the clue for the diagnosis. Xanthinuria is a rare hereditary condition transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. The enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for the conversion of xanthine and hypoxanthine to uric acid, is deficient. Xanthine stone formation occurs in one-third of patients with this disorder. Similar stones are seen as a complication of allopurinol therapy since this drug blocks xanthine oxidase activity.⁶²⁶

# Light Chain Cast Nephropathy

Light chain cast nephropathy, also known as Bence Jones cast nephropathy, myeloma cast nephropathy, or myeloma kidney, is the most common form of renal disease associated with multiple myeloma.⁶²⁷ Clinically, it may present as progressive renal insufficiency or acute renal failure, often precipitated by dehydration, hypercalcemia, IV infusion of contrast media, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hyperuricemia, nephrotoxic infections, or loop diuretics.

Rewrite the following pathology text into a more formal and comprehensive paragraph suitable for a pathology report. STATEMENT: # Light Chain Cast Nephropathy

Large, dense PAS-negative tubular casts associated with tubular injury and intratubular neutrophils (PAS).

As furosemide. Proteinuria is found, although not usually in the nephrotic range, and it most often consists predominantly of immunoglobulin light chains (Bence Jones protein). Circulating monoclonal light chains can be confirmed by serum protein electrophoresis or free light chain assay. The light chains are normally filtered by the glomeruli and reabsorbed and metabolized by proximal tubular cells. In patients with multiple myeloma, the excess monoclonal light chains overwhelm the catabolic capacity of the proximal tubules, thus allowing them to reach the distal nephron where the presence of Tamm–Horsfall protein may facilitate their precipitation in the form of voluminous casts. These monoclonal free light chains can also cause proximal tubular cell cytotoxicity, TIN, and ultimately damage the entire nephron, resulting in renal failure.

By light microscopy, the distal and collecting tubules appear occluded by numerous dense, markedly eosinophilic, lamellated and fractured casts, sometimes surrounded by multinucleated giant cells derived from interstitial macrophages that invade the tubules through breaks in the basement membrane. Some casts may exhibit Congo red and thioflavin T positivity, but this alone is not indicative of amyloidosis. The tubular cells may appear flattened or can show varying degrees of degeneration with necrosis and denudation of the tubular basement membranes. Depending on the stage of the disease, there is a variable degree of IF usually associated with acute and/or chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates. Prominent intratubular collections of neutrophils may be seen, mimicking acute pyelonephritis. Sometimes the casts may contain rhomboid or needle-shaped crystalline structures that may also be found in the tubular epithelium and, on rare occasions, in the glomeruli. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that the casts are largely made of the pathogenic light chain, either kappa or lambda (although kappa tends to be more frequent).

# Renal Vascular Disease

# Renal Arteriolar Disease

The kidney plays an essential role in hypertension, and the vessels of the kidney are susceptible to a variety of pathologic changes directly related to increased pressure. The vessels most susceptible are small arteries and arterioles, with preglomerular vessels being more prominently affected. Vascular narrowing of these intrarenal vessels eventually leads to glomerular sclerosis, TA, and IF (nephrosclerosis). The hypertensive vascular changes of the small vessels of the kidney fall into three general categories: hyaline arteriolosclerosis, myointimal hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and fibrinoid necrosis.

In hyaline arteriolosclerosis, the outer part of the wall of affected vessels is thickened by deposition of a homogeneous, eosinophilic, PAS-positive material. Associated changes are atrophy of the smooth muscle cells in the vessel walls and a uniform thickening of the basement membrane. Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is most marked in the afferent arteriole and in smaller vessels lacking an internal elastic lamina. Mild hyaline arteriolosclerosis is often seen with increasing age, but it is more prominent in patients with hypertension or diabetes. The effects are more marked in hypertension where the arteriolar lumens become severely narrowed, causing diffuse renal ischemia and symmetric shrinking of the kidneys. It is believed that the hyaline deposition results from leakage of plasma components across the vascular endothelium, triggering extracellular matrix production by smooth muscle cells. The hyalinized arterioles usually immunoreact for IgM and complement components, especially C3. Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is a major morphologic feature in benign nephrosclerosis, in which the interlobular and arcuate arteries may also exhibit medial hypertrophy and reduplication of the elastic lamina.

The second type of vascular abnormality seen in hypertension is that hyperplasia involving the smooth muscle and intima of small arteries and arterioles (myointimal hypertrophy and hyperplasia). Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis is generally associated with acute or persistent severe high blood pressure and, therefore, is seen more often in accelerated/malignant than benign hypertension. In the early stages, the lesions are characterized by profuse intimal thickening by myxoid and sparse cellular connective tissue that drastically reduces the vascular lumen. Over time, this acute change shows progressive intimal scarring and uniform concentric thickening of the vessel wall by a proliferation of myointimal cells, and deposition of basement membrane–like material. The microscopic appearance of this lesion has led to the descriptive term of “onion skinning.”

Focally disrupted or separated from the GBM by the accumulation of electron-lucent material. On occasion, subendothelial or intracapillary strands of fibrin may be seen. Immunofluorescence microscopy may reveal fibrin, fibrinogen, IgM, and complement components in a segmental distribution.

# Renal Arterial Disease

The larger arteries in the kidney can also be the site of renal vascular disease. Atheromatous involvement is accelerated in patients with hypertension and may be a source of atheromatous emboli and give rise to renal parenchymal infarcts. Arteries down to the arcuate size can show arteriosclerotic changes, but smaller vessels are more commonly involved by intimal thickening of the hyperplastic type, similar to that seen in the small arteries. Disease of the major arteries becomes particularly important when it involves a main renal artery and causes significant stenosis, resulting in secondary hypertension.

Fibrinoid necrosis of the afferent arteriole has been regarded as the hallmark of accelerated (malignant) hypertension. The necrosis is usually superimposed on a preexisting hyperplastic or hyaline lesion, but it can be the initial event in young patients with severe acute malignant hypertension. The architecture of the media of affected vessels is obliterated by the necrotizing process and further obscured by deposition of deeply eosinophilic, fibrillar material which, by histochemical and immunofluorescent techniques, has been demonstrated to be fibrin and fibrinogen. The arteriolar lumen may be reduced in size as a result of wall thickening, extravasation of red blood cells, and intraluminal thrombosis.

In malignant hypertension, the glomeruli often show variable degrees of ischemic change, characterized by wrinkling and collapse of the capillary walls. In addition to this diffuse pattern of ischemic damage, segmental lesions such as apparent necrosis in direct continuity with arteriolar lesions may be seen. By electron microscopy, the endothelium often appears swollen and sometimes disrupted.

Major complications of the lesions include saccular or dissecting aneurysm formation and the occurrence of cholesterol emboli. Microscopically, these emboli appear as needle-like spaces representing cholesterol crystals embedded in amorphous debris frequently surrounded by multinucleated giant cells. Although symptomatic presentation is rare, cholesterol emboli occur immediately after or with a few months of angiographic or surgical procedures involving vessels.

The second group of conditions that leads to stenosis are dysplastic lesions of the renal artery, currently termed fibromuscular dysplasia, which account for less than 10% of the cases of renal artery stenosis. These lesions can involve other systemic vessels, suggesting that there may be an underlying defect in vessel structure, and can become clinically important when they cause obstruction of a major renal artery, thereby leading to severe hypertension unresponsive to antihypertensive drugs. Typically, these lesions occur in the distal two-thirds of the artery and are bilateral in 50% of the cases. Fibromuscular dysplasia can be divided into three types: intimal, medial, and periarterial/adventitial. The medial category in turn consists of three subtypes: medial fibroplasia, medial hyperplasia, and perimedial fibroplasia. As the terms indicate, differences are somewhat subtle, but given that different patient populations may be affected in each subgroup, this categorization is clinically useful.

The lesion in intimal fibromuscular dysplasia is hyperplasia of the intima, and microscopically it is virtually indistinguishable from the proliferative stage of atherosclerosis, although it is not associated with an increased deposition of lipids. The architecture of the elastica and media are preserved so the only abnormality in the vessel wall is the intimal hyperplasia. Individuals as young as 1 year of age have been affected, but it is seen more often in the third and fourth decades. The most common of the dysplastic lesions is medial fibroplasia. In this condition, multiple foci of stenosis alternating with microaneurysms produce a “string of beads” appearance. Microscopically, atrophy of the muscle coat and fibrosis of the media near small aneurysms alternate with foci of muscular hypertrophy and fibrosis in the stenotic areas. Second in frequency is perimedial fibroplasia. In this variant, segmental aneurysmal dilation does not occur, and the outer half of the media, elastica, and intima maintain their normal architecture. Medial hyperplasia is seen less frequently. Hyperplasia of the muscle produces a uniform circumferential thickening of the vessel wall with narrowing of the lumen. Periarterial fibromuscular dysplasia is a rare lesion in which fibrosis of the adventitia extends into the surrounding adipose and connective tissue, causing extrinsic constriction of the vessel (rather than thickening from within the wall).

Among the miscellaneous causes of renal artery stenosis, radiation injury is of particular interest. The lesion is characterized by a loss of muscle and an intense fibrosis in all layers of the vessel wall. It is usually a distant event that follows radiation therapy for a malignant tumor where the renal artery was included in the irradiated area. Takayasu aortitis or pulseless disease is a chronic sclerosing aortitis of unknown etiology that can cause renal artery stenosis from narrowing of the ostium. An inflammatory infiltrate with giant cells is frequently present, suggesting an immunologic mechanism. An ischemic kidney is smaller than the contralateral kidney, irrespective of the etiology. Glomeruli are small with ischemic wrinkling of the basement membranes, and the tubules are atrophic. The atrophic tubules have simplified epithelium with inconspicuous lumina mimicking parathyroid, often referred to as “endocrine.”

change.” IF is present, and the hyperplastic juxtaglomerular apparatus atrophy are common findings and may be severe. Regeneration is often abnormal so that the cells may have poorly formed cytoplasm and abnormal nuclei. The interstitium is focally scarred and has no significant inflammation.

# Radiation Nephropathy

Radiation nephropathy is the term used to designate the renal disease that occurs with irradiation of the abdomen (or total body) during the treatment of malignant tumors. More recently, this has also been noted in association with use of radiolabeled substances such as monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, and low-molecular-weight oncophilic peptides. Although the term acute radiation nephritis has also been used for this disease, since no inflammation occurs immediately after kidney irradiation and histologic examination of the radiation-damaged kidneys usually reveals only minimal proliferation and inflammatory changes, the terms acute and chronic radiation nephropathy, rather than nephritis, are preferred. The severity of the pathologic changes in the damaged kidney depends upon multiple factors, including radiation dosage, method of irradiation, age of the patient, amount of perirenal fat, preexistence of renal disease, and the concomitant use of chemotherapeutic agents, as well as individual susceptibility. In general, a radiation dose of 9.8 Gy in the absence of exposure to nephrotoxic drugs and other predisposing factors is associated with 5% incidence of kidney toxicity.

Acute radiation nephropathy usually occurs 6–12 months after radiation exposure. However, the period of latency can be shorter, especially in children. Clinically, the disease is manifested by the gradual onset of edema, hypertension, dyspnea on exercise, pleural and peritoneal serous effusions, anemia, headaches, and urinary changes, which include proteinuria and the presence of casts. Rare cases of radiation nephropathy causing nephrotic syndrome have been reported. The glomerular filtration rate decreases and over half of the patients progress to renal failure. Those who recover from the acute episode usually have persistent proteinuria and renal impairment. On occasion, malignant hypertension may develop during the acute radiation syndrome. The mortality of patients with this complication is high.

Chronic radiation nephropathy either follows the acute phase or develops insidiously over a period of years. Although no specific threshold has been established for total cumulative radiation exposure that leads to this form of injury, it appears that relatively small doses of radiation (500–1000 rad) may, in susceptible individuals, cause renal damage. In most patients, the findings of mild proteinuria and moderate hypertension are not detected until many years after radiation exposure.

Depending on the severity and the stage of the disease, kidney biopsies from patients with radiation nephropathy will show a wide range of glomerular changes. Some glomeruli may appear segmentally or completely scarred, while others may show no significant changes. Segmental areas of fibrinoid necrosis of the tuft in continuity with similar changes in the arterioles may be seen. The glomerular capillary walls may be thickened, and a double contour may be demonstrated by silver impregnation techniques. The mesangium may be prominent as a result of an increase in mesangial matrix. Mesangiolysis and adhesions to the Bowman capsule may be seen. Vascular injury is manifested by fibrinoid necrosis of the arterioles and small arteries, sometimes accompanied by thrombosis. A loose myxoid intimal thickening involving arterioles and interlobular arteries is a frequent feature. The glomerular and vascular changes are within the spectrum of pathology seen in TMA. Swelling of the tubular epithelium with desquamation of the cells, and basement membrane thickening and splitting followed by tubular loss.

# Cystic Diseases of the Kidney

Renal cystic diseases are a large family of hereditary, sporadic, developmental, and acquired disorders characterized by the presence of cysts in one or both kidneys. Only the most common cystic renal diseases will be discussed in this section. A subset of hereditary cystic diseases with gene mutations involving primary (nonmotile) cilia is now being reclassified as “ciliopathies.” This category of disease includes autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), and nephronophthisis (NPHP), and other related ciliopathies. Primary cilia are antenna-like projections on the apical surfaces of almost all cells and consist of a basal body and an axoneme with nine peripheral doublets. Primary cilia detect flow as well as a variety of stimuli and participate in transmembrane transport of proteins.

# Multicystic Renal Dysplasia

In this disorder, the development of the kidney is disorganized because of anomalous differentiation of the metanephros.

# Multicystic Renal Dysplasia

Multicystic renal dysplasia is the most common form of cystic renal disease in children and the most common cause of abdominal masses in newborns. The dysplasia is usually unilateral but can be bilateral, segmental, or focal. Abnormalities of the collecting system are common and include obstruction of the uretero-pelvic junction, ureteral atresia, and urethral obstruction. Malformations of other organs, especially of the heart, can occur in conjunction with renal dysplasia. The clinical presentation largely depends on the extent of the dysplastic involvement and the degree of associated urinary obstruction. Most dysplastic kidneys arise sporadically but a few are familial or occur in syndromes of multiple malformations. A large reniform mass of cysts of various sizes obscures any renal parenchyma that may be present. In focal and segmental dysplasia, only part of the kidney is involved by the dysplasia and cyst formation. Microscopically, the findings are quite characteristic. The cysts are lined by cuboidal epithelial cells and surrounded by immature stromal elements. Primitive tubules and glomerular structures may be present, as may islands of dysplastic mesenchyme including cartilage and fibromuscular tissue.

# Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease

ADPKD is a hereditary condition characterized by expanding cysts that progressively destroy the renal parenchyma of both kidneys, ultimately causing renal failure. It is one of the most common hereditary human disorders, occurring in about 1 or 2 per 1000 live births and accounting for approximately 10% of cases requiring dialysis or renal transplantation. The pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant with complete penetrance, and each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The disease is genetically heterogeneous and is caused by a mutation in two genes, PKD1 and PKD2, that are located on chromosomes 16p13.3 and 4q13–23, respectively. The protein products of the PKD genes, polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, have similar cellular distribution resulting in phenotypic similarities between PKD1- and PKD2-mutated ADPKD. Polycystin-1 is an epithelial cell membrane receptor involved in signaling of renal tubular epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. Polycystin-2 has similarities to a sodium/calcium channel and likely modulates intracellular calcium levels; this ion channel function is enabled by heterodimerization of polycystin 1 and 2. The polycystin complex is implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle via multiple transduction pathways, as well as in the mechanosensory function of the renal primary cilium. Abnormalities in tubular cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell polarity, and secretions have been detected within the cysts. Mutations in the PKD1 gene are responsible for about 85%–90% of all cases of ADPKD, while mutations in PKD2 cause the disease in the majority of the remaining patients. A small number of families with ADPKD do not demonstrate linkage to either PKD1 or PKD2, which suggests the potential presence of an as yet unidentified PKD3 gene. Males and females are affected equally, and there is no racial predilection. Although it can present at any time during life, it most frequently becomes symptomatic during the fourth and fifth decades with a gradual onset of renal failure. Early-onset ADPKD can occur rarely in children, causing a diagnostic challenge, and the presence of glomerular cysts should favor ADPKD.

Clinical manifestations of ADPKD include flank pain, flank masses, hematuria, hypertension, and renal failure. Approximately 20% of patients with ADPKD develop nephrolithiasis, and uric acid stones are more common than calcium oxalate stones. Although individuals with PKD1 are clinically indistinguishable from those with PKD2, the latter patients have a less severe disease course with a later mean age at diagnosis, onset of hypertension, and ESRD. Radiographic findings are usually diagnostic, and sonography and computed tomography are reliable procedures for the demonstration of early involvement. Gene linkage analysis allows prenatal diagnosis but requires at least four affected family members. Although direct sequencing is more sensitive, even by this method, only 70% of ADPKD mutations are detected.

ADPKD is bilateral, but significant asynchrony of involvement of the kidneys may be noted on occasion. The kidneys are markedly enlarged and have a bosselated outer cortical surface produced by multiple cysts of varying sizes. When the disease is severe, normal renal parenchyma is apparent only microscopically. The cysts develop in all segments of the renal tubule and glomerular capsule as saccular expansions or diverticula. In the early stages, the fluid of the cysts is derived from glomerular filtrate. As the cysts enlarge, however, they commonly become disconnected from the tubule of origin, thereafter filling with fluid exclusively by transepithelial secretion. On light microscopy, the cysts are lined by cuboidal, flattened epithelium, and hyperplastic polypoid foci are often found. Intervening renal parenchyma appears relatively normal, although foci of interstitial scarring, TA, and IF are common. The development of renal adenomas has been reported to occur in about 20% of patients with ADPKD.

develop renal failure, hypertension, and portal hypertension. The estimated perinatal mortality is 30%–50%; for those who survive the first month of life, the reported mean 5-year survival rate is 80%–95%.676,683

The kidneys are markedly enlarged bilaterally but retain their reniform configuration. The cysts tend to be linear and radiate from the medulla to the outer cortex. They develop in the collecting ducts, which expand to a large size due to fluid accumulation within the cyst cavity. Microscopically, the cysts appear as dilated tubular structures lined by cuboidal or flattened epithelium. The intervening tissue may contain uninvolved nephrons, but this depends on the severity of the disorder.

# Nephronophthisis

Although NPHP has traditionally been grouped with medullary cystic kidney disease based on similarities in their clinical and pathologic features, these conditions are now regarded as two distinct entities.⁶⁸⁴ NPHP is an autosomal recessive cystic disease characterized by tubular basement membrane disruption, IF, and cyst formation. It is the most frequent genetic cause of ESRD in children and adolescents, accounting for 10%–20% of cases of renal failure in this age group.⁶⁸⁵

Three clinical forms, referred to as juvenile, 686 infantile, 687 and adolescent,⁶⁸⁸ with a median age at onset of ESRD of 13 years, 1–3 years, and 19 years, respectively, have been recognized. NPHP is genetically heterogeneous, and mutations have been detected in increasing number of genes.⁶⁸⁹ The mutations are in genes encoding primary cilia proteins (NPHP1-NPHP18, NPHPL1, NPHP2L, AHI1, CC2D2A, MSK1, ATXN10, B9D2), and patients often have associated renal disease of NPHP, which is now considered a form of “ciliopathy.”690,691 Majority of proteins encoded by the NPHP genes are known as nephrocystins, and it has been proposed that mutated proteins alter the function of primary cilia, causing renal cystic disease and, in some, extrarenal manifestations. 684,691

# Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease

ARPKD is a rare hereditary disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 per 20,000 live births.⁶⁷³ ARPKD is caused by mutations of a gene located on chromosome 6p21.1–p12 named polycystic kidney hepatic disease gene (PKHD1)674,675 whose related protein polyductin,⁶⁷⁶ also known as fibro-cystin,⁶⁷⁷ is highly expressed in the epithelial cells of the collecting ducts and thick ascending loops of Henle and, to a lesser extent, in the biliary and pancreatic duct epithelia.⁶⁷⁸ Of date, more than 300 PKHD1 mutations have been identified and the majority of patients are compound heterozygotes. 679 As in other polycystic kidney diseases, polyductin localizes to the primary cilia of the renal epithelial cells. 678 Although the liver and both kidneys are invariably affected, the severity of involvement varies, thus creating a spectrum of clinical presentation. 680 In the neonatal period, the renal symptoms usually predominate.⁶⁸¹ Truncating PKHD1 mutations are associated with severe neonatal disease. 682 Later in life, patients seek medical attention because of hepatic disease, which consists of congenital hepatic fibrosis with a variable degree of biliary dysgenesis and bile duct ectasia. These patients may also develop portal hypertension with hepatosplenomegaly and esophageal varices. Histologic findings are nonspecific and depend on the severity of the disease.

Typical signs and symptoms of NPHP include the inability to concentrate urine, polydipsia, anuresis, severe anemia, and growth retardation. The disease occurs in a pure renal form in approximately 85% of the patients. About 12% of the cases are associated with retinitis pigmentosa (Senior–Løken syndrome). 692–694 Other less common associations that have been described include hepatic fibrosis, skeletal malformations, and various defects in the central nervous system. Clinical syndromes described with NPHP and extrarenal manifestations include Bardet–Biedl syndrome, Joubert syndrome, and Meckel–Gruber syndrome. 690,691

All types of NPHP have similar macroscopic and histopathologic features. Renal involvement is always bilateral. Both kidneys are moderately reduced in size and exhibit a granular surface. On cut sections, the cortex and medulla are both thinned. The cortico-medullary junction is indistinct and typically the site of a variable number of thin-walled, fluid-filled cysts, ranging in size from barely visible up to 2.0 cm in diameter. The cysts may also occur deeper in the renal medulla and occasionally in the papillae. Microdissection studies have shown that the cysts arise from the loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubules, and collecting ducts. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis with lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate, TA, and cyst formation is seen. The TA is often accompanied by a marked thickening of the tubular basement membrane and is better seen in PAS-stained sections. Pools of Tamm–Horsfall protein without clinical evidence of obstructive or reflux nephropathy in a young patient should prompt genetic evaluation for NPHP. By electron microscopy, these basement membranes can appear homogeneously thickened, split into thin lamellae, reticulated, or completely disintegrated.⁶⁹⁵

Rewrite the following pathology text into a more formal and comprehensive paragraph suitable for a pathology report. STATEMENT: Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease

Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) represents a new terminology for a group of disorders that are characterized by TA, IF, thickening and lamellation of tubular basement membranes, and in some cases, tubular microcysts. This entity encompasses mucin-1–related kidney disease (MUC-1), uromodulin-related kidney disease (UMOD), renin mutation with tubulointerstitial nephritis (REN), and kidney disease due to HNF1β mutation (HNF1B), with two former diseases being most frequently encountered.696,697 ADTKD-MUC1 was previously referred to as medullary cystic kidney disease type I (MCKD1), and the previous terminology for ADTKD-UMOD was medullary cystic kidney disease type 2 (MCKD2). These disorders share clinical and morphologic similarities with NPHP, but cysts are not uniformly observed. 650,696

Patients with ADTKD-MUC1 develop progressive renal failure in adulthood. The median age at end-stage kidney disease is 62 years, although it varies within families.⁶⁹⁸ The disease is caused by mutations in MUC1 gene that maps to chromosome 1q21. 696,699 The protein, mucin-1, is expressed in distal tubules and collecting ducts and presumably protects the epithelial surfaces from bacteria. ADTKD-UMOD is caused by mutations in UMOD gene located on chromosome 16p12.700,701 The mutant uromodulin (Tamm–Horsfall protein) is misfolded, leading to accumulation within the endoplasmic reticulum of the thick ascending loop of Henle and distal tubules. The end-stage renal failure occurs from 20–70 years, with a median age being 54 years. 700,701

Both MUC-1 and UMOD-associated ADTKD patients have minimal proteinuria accompanying chronic renal failure and usually lack extrarenal disease.696,697 There is an association with hyperuricemia and gout, especially in ADTKD-UMOD patients. 700,701 The kidneys are normal or moderately reduced in size. Small corticomedullary cysts may be seen in both diseases and in ADTKD-UMOD, cysts can also be detected in cortex and medulla. Microscopically, there is diffuse interstitial inflammation with fibrosis and TA interspersed with hypertrophied and dilated tubules. Ultrastructural similarities with NPHP include tubular basement membrane lamellation. Patients with UMOD mutations have characteristic intracytoplasmic fibrillar inclusions composed of uromodulin in the thick ascending loops of Henle and on rare occasion, glomerular cysts. 702

Interstitial nephritis attributable to mutated REN, a gene encoding renin, is rare, and renal cysts are not a typical feature in these patients. Anemia and hyperuricemia are common presenting features along with chronic renal failure.⁶⁹⁶ Heterozygous mutations in REN result in reduced production of renin in juxtaglomerular cells and intracellular accumulation of unfolded precursor protein causes accelerated apoptosis and nephron loss. 703,704 Up to a third of patients with HNF1β mutations have congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract, and the age at presentation in such instances is typically in utero and in young children. 705 The renal cysts can be either widespread or limited to glomeruli and adjacent parenchyma often shows features of dysplasia. Adults with these mutations come to attention due to unexplained chronic renal failure, minimal proteinuria, and tubulointerstitial disease. 706 The transcription factor HNF1β is also expressed in pancreas and hence the association with maturity onset diabetes mellitus.

# Medullary Sponge Kidney

Medullary sponge kidney (MSK) is a renal cystic disorder characterized by tubular ectasia of the collecting ducts and cyst formation confined to the medullary pyramids. 707 It typically affects both kidneys and represents developmental malformation of the collecting system.

The true incidence of MSK is unknown, although it has been estimated at 1 per 5000 population. 708 The disease is asymptomatic unless complicated by nephrolithiasis, hematuria, or infections. In these instances, the diagnosis is established when the patient undergoes radiographic examination.⁷⁰⁹ Typically, symptoms start in adulthood, but presentation in adolescence and childhood has been reported.⁷¹⁰ In patients with recurrent nephrolithiasis, the stones are composed of calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphate and a third of the patients have distal renal tubular acidosis. Both sexes are equally affected. Most cases appear sporadically, but a few familial clusters have been documented. 710 MSK has been reported in association with various conditions such as hemihypertrophy, Wilms tumor, congenital hepatic fibrosis, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), Marfan syndrome, and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. Mutations or polymorphisms of glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) genes (previously known to be involved in genitourinary development) have been recently reported in MSK, confirming a genetic component in a minority of patients.⁷¹¹

The involved kidneys are usually normal in size, but they can be slightly enlarged in those cases with pronounced sponge-like changes. The cysts are multiple, small, and limited to the medullary pyramids and papillae. They usually affect all pyramids in both kidneys; however, on occasion, only one or two pyramids or only one kidney may be affected. The cysts are lined by collecting duct epithelium and usually communicate with collecting tubules. Concretions adherent to the walls of the cysts and the dilated collecting ducts may be seen. The interstitium often shows severe inflammation and scarring, frequently accompanied by TA, especially near the papillary tips. In instances where there is nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis, the cortex may show significant cortical scarring.

# Acquired Renal Cystic Disease

Although acquired renal cystic disease (ARCD) was initially reported in patients undergoing long-term dialysis, similar changes can also occur in uremic nondialyzed patients. 712 ARCD has been reported to occur in 7%–22% of patients with renal failure who are not on dialysis, 40% of patients who have been on dialysis for 3 years, and 80%–90% of patients who have been on dialysis for 10 years or more.⁷¹³ The etiology of ARCD has not yet been well established, and it has been suggested that the cysts found in this condition result from obstruction of the renal tubules by local fibrosis, oxalate deposition, or epithelial hyperplasia. The cysts often regress after transplantation. Men are more affected than women. In most cases, the disease is asymptomatic, but sometimes the cysts bleed, rupture, or become infected, causing fever, hematuria, and flank pain. The most serious complication, however, is the development of renal carcinomas in the walls of the cysts. It has been estimated that renal cell carcinoma is found 50 times more frequently in dialysis patients with ARCD than in the general population.

The cysts in ARCD are usually bilateral and occur in both the renal cortex and medulla. 714 Their number can vary from a few subcapsular cysts to diffuse involvement of almost the entire renal parenchyma. A diagnosis of ARCD requires five or more cysts are found on imaging studies and absence of known cystic renal disease as the cause of renal failure. The cysts are filled with straw-colored or hemorrhagic fluid and often contain calcium oxalate crystals. Most cysts are less than 0.5 cm, but they can measure up to 2–3 cm in diameter. Microscopically, cysts are lined by flattened epithelium or by hyperplastic cuboidal or columnar cells with prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm, sometimes forming papillary projections. Renal neoplasms arising in this setting are fully discussed in Chapter 24.⁷¹⁵

Simple cysts are the most common cystic abnormality encountered in the kidneys. They are found in about 5%–12% of the general population undergoing abdominal ultrasound examination for various reasons. Their occurrence increases with age, with an incidence of less than 0.1% in children and up to 20% in individuals over 50 years of age. They are usually asymptomatic and are often detected at autopsy or as an incidental finding in the radiologic evaluation for other diseases. On occasion, however, when complicated by hemorrhage or infection, they can cause pain. Simple cysts can be solitary or multiple and bilateral. They occur more commonly in the renal cortex, and although their etiology has not been well established, it is believed that they originate from diverticula of cortical tubules. Most are under 5 cm in diameter, but larger cysts have been documented. Usually unilocular, on occasion they can be bilocular or multilocular. The cysts are normally translucent, filled with clear serous fluid, and lined by a single layer of cuboidal or flattened epithelium. Cases complicated by hemorrhage or infection can have thick capsular walls with hemosiderin-laden macrophages and atrophic lining epithelium.

# Pediatric Tumors and Tumorlike Conditions

# Nephroblastic Tumors

# Wilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma)

# General Features

Wilms tumor is also known as nephroblastoma (currently the preferred term). It constitutes the prototypical example of a neoplastic process that faithfully recapitulates embryogenesis at the morphologic and molecular levels. It is seen primarily in infants, 50% of the cases occurring before the age of 3 years and 90% before the age of 6 years. However, Wilms tumor is only exceptionally seen as a congenital neoplasm, a point of great importance in the differential diagnosis with mesoblastic nephroma. There are also well-documented cases of Wilms tumors in adolescents and adults, but this may represent a somewhat different disease with distinct genetic features and significantly worse clinical outcomes. There is no appreciable sex predilection. The risk in Caucasians is lower than in Asians, but higher than in patients of African descent. The incidence of congenital abnormalities of the urogenital tract is particularly high for Wilms tumors occurring during the first.

This chapter covers the entire spectrum of neoplasms and non-neoplastic tumoral lesions that may involve the kidney. Pediatric tumors are detailed and include Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma), clear cell sarcoma of kidney, congenital mesoblastic nephroma, rhabdoid tumor, and cystic nephroma. The metanephric family of tumors is also addressed. An update on specific subtypes of renal cell carcinoma is provided, based on the 2016 WHO classification, and newer emerging entities are also covered. Other less common intrarenal neoplasms are also highlighted. Finally, lesions of the upper urinary tract (i.e. renal pelvis and ureter) are discussed.

# Clinical Features

The classic clinical presentation of Wilms tumor is in the form of an abdominal mass felt by the mother when handling the child. Hematuria and pain are rare. Hypertension, present in a minority of the cases, has been shown to be caused by renin secretion by the tumor. Proteinuria may be the result of tumor-associated glomerular disease in the non-neoplastic kidney. Sometimes the first symptoms are related to traumatic rupture. Cases have been reported presenting as sudden death resulting from tumor embolism.

Imaging studies show a solid intrarenal mass that often displaces and distorts the collecting system. Foci of calcification may be identified.

# Morphologic Features

Grossly, most Wilms tumors are solitary, well circumscribed, rounded, and of soft consistency. Their size is extremely variable, and their median weight is 550 g. The cut section is predominantly solid and pale gray or tan and often exhibits areas of cystic change, necrosis, and hemorrhage. A lobular pattern resulting from fibrous septation is common. Multicentric tumor foci are found in 7% of the cases.

Microscopically, three major components are identified: undifferentiated blastema, mesenchymal (stromal) tissue, and epithelial tissue. Most Wilms tumors show a representation of all three components, but the proportions vary widely from case to case and sometimes from region to region in the same tumor. Some tumors are biphasic, and still others are monophasic (monomorphous).

The blastomatous areas are extremely cellular and composed of small round-to-oval primitive cells; the cytoplasm is usually very scant, but sometimes is more abundant and exhibits an oncocytoid appearance. Adjacent nuclei commonly appear to overlap. The pattern of growth may be diffuse, nodular, cordlike (serpentine), or basaloid (with peripheral palisading). Particularly on biopsy, Wilms tumors in which the blastomatous component predominates can be confused with any of the small round cell tumors (including neuroblastoma), rhabdoid tumor, or clear cell sarcoma of kidney.

# Immunohistochemical Features

The immunohistochemical profile of the various components of Wilms tumor mirrors that of their counterparts in the developing kidney. The epithelial elements react for keratin and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA); the mesenchymal elements show a reactivity pattern consonant with their morphologic appearance.

underlying genetic alteration in Denys–Drash syndrome and WAGR syndrome, respectively.⁶⁸⁻⁷⁰ WT2 is located in 11p15.5, which contains the gene for insulin growth factor II, and is implicated in tumors associated with Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome.⁷¹⁻⁷⁴ Alterations of these genes may also be identified in sporadic tumors. A relationship has been shown between the level of expression of these genes and the microscopic features of the tumor. 68,75-79

Inactivation of the WTX gene located on the X chromosome is found in 6%–30% of cases of sporadic Wilms tumor.79,80 This results from somatic deletion or, less commonly, inactivating mutation of the gene on the single X chromosome in tumors of males or the active X chromosome in tumors of females. 81-83 The pathogenetic role of WTX alteration in Wilms tumor is not fully elucidated, but downregulation of WTX leads to increased signaling in the Wnt pathway.⁸³

Activating mutation of the β-catenin gene CTNNB1 is found in 14%–20% of Wilms tumors, resulting in disturbance of the Wnt signaling pathway. It may be found in tumors with WT1 mutation, but not with WT1 wild-type.⁸⁴⁻⁸⁶

Abnormalities in other chromosomes—1, 7q, 8, 12, and 16—have also been encountered.14,87,88 These genetic changes are identical in the various histologic components of the tumor, and 1p and 16q loss of heterozygosity (LOH) are discussed further under prognosis.⁸⁹

Figure 24.3 Mucinous epithelium in Wilms tumor.

Mutations of TP53 and/or overexpression of the protein are found in only 5% of the cases of Wilms tumor. They are largely restricted to the anaplastic foci and carry an unfavorable prognostic connotation.90,91 Similarly, MYCN amplification is seen in rare cases with aggressive behavior, most commonly with diffuse anaplasia. More recently, mutations in the SIX/2 pathway and the DROSHA/DGCR8 miRNA microprocessor complex have been described in high-risk blastemal Wilms tumors.⁹²

# Spread and Metastases

In advanced cases, local spread occurs in the perirenal soft tissues. From here, the tumor may directly involve the adrenal glands, bowel, liver, vertebrae, and paraspinal region; the latter may result in spinal cord compression. 93 Invasion of the renal vein is common, but extension into the renal pelvis or ureter is a rare and late event.

| Stage I   | Completely resected tumor limited to the kidney. No intraoperative rupture or biopsy of the tumor prior to removal. No involvement of the vessels of the renal sinus. No evidence of tumor beyond the margins of resection. Regional lymph nodes confirmed negative microscopically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Stage II  | Completely resected tumor with no evidence of tumor at or beyond margins of resection. Tumor extends beyond the kidney as evidenced by regional extension of the tumor (through renal capsule, extensive invasion of the soft tissue of the renal sinus) or tumor in blood vessels within the nephrectomy specimen, but outside renal parenchyma. This includes blood vessels of the renal sinus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Stage III | Residual tumor present after surgery, confined to abdomen. This includes the following: • Lymph nodes within the abdomen/pelvis are involved by tumor. • Tumor has penetrated through the peritoneal surface. • Tumor implants are on the peritoneal surface. • Gross or microscopic tumor remains postoperatively (positive surgical margins on microscopic exam). • Involvement of vital structures precludes complete resection. • Tumor spillage before or during surgery. • Tumor is treated with preoperative chemotherapy (with or without any prior biopsy, including fine-needle aspiration). • Tumor is removed in more than one piece (e.g. tumor is found in tissues separate from nephrectomy specimen, such as separately excised adrenal, or separately removed thrombus from renal vein). • Extension of primary tumor into thoracic vena cava and/or heart. |
| Stage IV  | Hematogenous metastases or lymph node metastases outside the abdominopelvic region.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Stage V   | Bilateral renal involvement present at diagnosis. Each kidney should be substaged separately by above criteria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Metastases in regional lymph nodes are found in 15% of the cases. The most common sites of distant metastases are lungs, liver, and peritoneum. The presence of lung metastases in a child with a retroperitoneal neoplasm strongly favors a diagnosis of Wilms tumor over that of neuroblastoma. Conversely, the presence of bone metastases suggests a diagnosis other than Wilms tumor, since they occur in only 1% of the cases.

# Therapy

The therapy for Wilms tumor has been relatively standardized and is based largely on protocols from either the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) or the Children’s Oncology Group (COG). The specifics of these protocols are being continuously updated. The main differences between the two approaches are based on the use of presurgical therapy. The SIOP typically espouses preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. In this model, some regions require biopsies to confirm diagnosis prior to chemotherapy, while others do not. Further therapy is based on the initial response as measured by a post-therapy classification. Advocates of the SIOP approach cite fewer intraoperative tumor ruptures (due to therapy-related tumor shrinkage) and less upstaging. The COG typically advocates for initial surgical resection with subsequent therapy determined by tumor histology and stage. Its advocates cite prognostic stratification that allows for more tailored therapy. Despite these differences, the clinical outcomes for both the SIOP and COG approaches are very similar.

# Prognosis

The overall cure rate for unilateral Wilms tumor is 80%–90%. A small percentage of long-term survivors of Wilms tumor develop a second malignant neoplasm, either because of a genetic predisposition to neoplasia or secondary to therapy. The prognostic connotations of various clinical and morphologic parameters are as follows:

1. Age. Patients under 2 years of age have significantly fewer metastases and a better 5-year survival rate than those over 2 years.
2. Size. Tumor mass, as measured by the weight of the excised specimen, is an important determinant of outcome, especially in stage I tumors.
3. Anaplasia. For a case of Wilms tumor to be placed into the anaplastic category, it should meet the following three criteria: (1) marked enlargement of nuclei within the blastemal, epithelial, or stromal cell lines (excepting skeletal muscle cells) to at least three times the diameter of adjacent nuclei of the same cell type; (2) obvious hyperchromasia of the enlarged nuclei; and (3) multipolar mitotic figures.

Anaplasia thus defined is present in about 4% of the cases, the incidence being higher in patients of African descent and in older patients. It is very uncommon in tumors from patients under 2 years of age; this is probably the reason for the better prognosis exhibited by this age group. Sometimes it is found in the metastases and not in the primary tumor.

# 6. Skeletal muscle differentiation

This feature does not seem to have a significant effect on prognosis, except when present in massive amounts. In the latter instance, it is said to be associated with a better prognosis.¹¹⁶⁻¹¹⁸ This finding does not currently direct initial therapy.

# 7. Post-chemotherapy morphology

The SIOP classification is based largely on response to chemotherapy with three simple categories: completely necrotic (low risk), blastemal predominant (high risk), and “others” (intermediate risk).¹⁰⁰ The incidence of anaplasia does not seem to be affected by this treatment modality (i.e. there is no evidence that therapy induces cytologic changes mimicking anaplasia).¹¹⁹

# 8. TP53 mutation

Mutations of the TP53 gene, evaluated indirectly through the immunohistochemical detection of P53 protein overexpression, correlate with the presence of anaplasia at the histologic level and therefore with an unfavorable outcome.120,121

# 9. LOH at 1p and 16q

Some studies have suggested that LOH at 1p and 16q is an adverse prognostic factor in favorable histology Wilms tumors. 122-125 Future COG and/or SIOP trials will likely attempt to further validate this finding.

Many of these prognostic parameters are used in the revised SIOP working classification for nephroblastoma (Table 24.2).

# Cystic Partially Differentiated Wilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma)

Cystic partially differentiated Wilms tumor typically occurs in very young children, most less than 24 months old.¹²⁶ By definition, this tumor should have an exclusively cystic gross appearance with thin septa and no solid nodules. It is typically large (mean of 10 cm), but well circumscribed. Histologically, the thin septa contain an admixture of different tissues, including fibrous tissue, skeletal muscle, fat, cartilage, blastema, and nephroblastomatous epithelium. Cysts may show papillary infolding, but no microscopic nodular masses should protrude from the cyst wall, as their presence suggests a cystic Wilms tumor. Hemorrhage, necrosis, and calcification are not features of cystic partially differentiated Wilms tumor. Surgical resection is typically curative and adjuvant therapy is not recommended for this clinically benign neoplasm. The main differential diagnosis is pediatric cystic nephroma, which (by definition) does not contain nephroblastomatous elements.

# Nephroblastomatosis and Nephrogenic Rests

Nephroblastomatosis and nephrogenic rests are defined as persistent foci of embryonal cells (after 36 weeks gestation), but they are discussed here because of their frequent confusion and histogenetic relationship with Wilms tumor. 2,127-129 Nephrogenic rests are seen in up to 40% of patients with Wilms tumor and approximately 1% of neonates.¹²⁷ The term nephroblastomatosis refers to diffuse or multifocal nephrogenic rests. In its most florid form, the process is often associated with a variety of congenital anomalies and with hypertension.¹³⁰

Nephrogenic rests have been divided into perilobar and intralobar forms (Fig. 24.5). The former, which is more common, is located peripherally, has sharply demarcated margins, is composed predominantly of blastema and tubules with scanty (or sclerotic) stroma, and is often multifocal. The intralobar form is randomly distributed in the cortex and medulla and has irregular margins. It shows a predominance of stroma over blastema and tubules and is usually solitary.¹³¹⁻¹³³ Further methods of nephrogenic rest subclassification have also been proposed. 132

Nephroblastomatosis can be diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound. 134 Grossly, the most exuberant examples of this disease can be.

| Stage I   | Viable tumor limited to the kidney, or surrounded by an intact fibrous pseudocapsule and completely resected. No renal sinus invasion of soft tissue or vessels. Necrotic tumor or chemotherapy induced changes may be present in renal sinus or soft tissue outside of kidney without upstaging, as long as these changes do not extend to resection margins. Prior percutaneous core needle (Tru-cut) biopsy or fine-needle aspiration does not upstage the tumor. Tumor may infiltrate adrenal gland if adrenal capsule is intact. Tumor may be adherent to liver capsule but may not infiltrate liver parenchyma. |

Each side should be substaged by above criteria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

distinguished from Wilms tumor because of the diffuse or multifocal nature of the process and the involvement of the entire subcapsular region. Microscopically, the mass is typically unencapsulated and composed of tightly packed nephrogenic epithelial cells that have a primitive but not anaplastic appearance. Stromal tissue is scanty; cartilage, striated cells, and primitive mesenchyme are absent. However, hyperplastic rests may have some foci that are cytologically indistinguishable from Wilms tumor, but have the distribution of a rest and no capsule. Other histologic mimics of nephrogenic rests include dysplastic medullary ray nodules (most commonly in Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome) and embryonal hyperplasia (often in multicystic dysplasia and end-stage kidneys). 135,136

In cases associated with Wilms tumor, they have been found to share similar mutations.¹³⁷ Perilobar rests often have 11p15 alterations and are commonly associated with hemihypertrophy and/or Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome, while intralobar rests commonly have WT1 mutations and may be associated with Denys–Drash syndrome.¹³⁸ CTNNB1 mutations are seen in intralobar rests, even in the absence of WT1 mutation.¹³⁹

A conservative therapeutic approach is indicated in cases of nephrogenic rests and nephroblastomatosis¹⁴⁰; however, nephrogenic rests in patients less than 1 year of age (particularly if perilobar) and especially diffuse hyperplastic nephroblastomatosis are associated with the highest risk of contralateral Wilms tumor. 141

# Congenital Mesoblastic Nephroma

Congenital mesoblastic nephroma represents the most common renal tumor of newborns and is usually discovered before 6 months of age.¹⁴² Extraordinary examples in adults have been reported, but the diagnosis is rare after 2 years of age and should be carefully scrutinized outside that setting. 143,144 Grossly, the tumor is solid, yellow-gray to tan, with a whorled configuration reminiscent of uterine leiomyoma (Fig. 24.6). Most are centered near the hilus of the kidney. The tumor often appears well circumscribed, but it may infiltrate the renal parenchyma and even the perirenal fat microscopically. Areas of hemorrhage and necrosis are usually absent. A cystic variant of this tumor has been described. 145,146

Figure 24.6 Congenital Mesoblastic Nephroma. Gross appearance of the well-circumscribed character of this tumor and its white fibrous cut surface are well illustrated.

Congenital mesoblastic nephromas lack the abnormalities in chromosome 11 that characterize Wilms tumor and are associated instead with polysomies for chromosomes 8, 11, 17, and 20. 151-153

Cellular congenital mesoblastic nephroma contains the t(12;15) (p13;q25) translocation, which results in the ETV6–NTRK3 gene fusion, the latter being detectable in paraffin-embedded material.154 This gene fusion is not found in classic mesoblastic nephroma.154,155

It appears that the occurrence of gene fusion antedates acquisition of chromosomal polysomies.152 The sharing of the same genetic abnormality between cellular congenital mesoblastic nephroma and infantile fibrosarcoma supports the notion that these two tumors represent a single neoplastic entity.152 Most mixed congenital mesoblastic nephromas lack the ETV6 fusion.156

The large majority of congenital mesoblastic nephromas are cured following nephrectomy.157 Therefore, radiation therapy or chemotherapy is not indicated. In up to 7% of the cases, recurrence with local invasion of retroperitoneum will occur and may prove fatal.148,158 Cases associated with distant metastases to lung and brain have rarely been reported159,160; most of these aggressive tumors have had atypical morphologic features.148,161

Figure 24.7 Congenital Mesoblastic Nephroma, Classic Type. Microscopic appearance showing a monotonous proliferation of spindle cells with bland nuclei, resembling fibromatosis.

There is typically fine intracellular collagen imparting a light eosinophilic appearance. Tubules and glomeruli (sometimes exhibiting hyperplastic or metaplastic changes) may be entrapped by the spindle tumor cells. Small islands of hyaline cartilage and foci of extramedullary hematopoiesis may be present. There is no capsule separating the tumor from the uninvolved renal parenchyma.

Cellular congenital mesoblastic nephroma is comprised of more densely cellular plump spindle cells with larger nuclei, resembling infantile fibrosarcoma (Fig. 24.8).148,149 They are mitotically active, have a tendency to infiltrate the renal pelvis or perirenal tissue, and may contain areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.150 When classic and cellular patterns coexist, the tumors are designated as mixed.

Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells often show expression of smooth muscle actin, while desmin staining is rare. CD34 is typically negative.

# Clear Cell Sarcoma

Clear cell sarcoma, formerly known as bone-metastasizing renal tumor and not to be confused with clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue, is a distinctive renal malignancy.142,164-166 It comprises approximately 4% of childhood renal tumors; its incidence peaks during the second year of life. Isolated cases have been described in adults167,168 and in association with familial colonic polyposis.169

Grossly, the tumor tends to be large, sharply outlined, and centered in the medullary or mid region of the kidney. They have a homogeneous cut surface of light brown-to-gray color and myxoid appearance.

Microscopically, the most common pattern is that of a diffuse growth of relatively small cells with round normochromatic nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, light-staining (sometimes vacuolated) cytoplasm, and indistinct cell margins (Fig. 24.10); however, the morphology is very heterogeneous. Despite the tumor name, clear cytoplasm is a prominent feature in only 20% of the cases. Nuclear grooves are common, and mitoses are infrequent. The fibrovascular stroma may result in arrangements of the tumor cells in nests, palisades, cords, or trabeculae (Fig. 24.11). The latter should not be confused with the tubules or the serpentine arrangement of Wilms tumor.

Myxoid changes, fibrosis, and hyalinization may be present, the appearance of the hyalinized tissue sometimes simulating osteoid (Fig. 24.12). Cysts may result from dilation of entrapped tubules or from stromal degeneration. It has been remarked that the distinctive alveolar and arborizing vascular stroma is a more reliable diagnostic.

Feature than the clear cells or the sclerosis. As many as nine histologic patterns of this tumor have been described, that is, classic, myxoid, sclerosing, cellular, epithelioid, palisading, spindle, storiform, and anaplastic.171

Clear cell sarcoma of kidney has recently been shown to harbor two main, and mutually exclusive, genetic events: somatic internal tandem duplication within the BCOR gene sequence (approximately 85%) and YWHAE-NUTM2 fusion (approximately 10%).172-175 A small subset of cases harbor neither event.172 These genetic features, as well as typical patient age and histology, are shared by a subset of extrarenal undifferentiated round cell sarcomas of infancy,176 suggesting a close relationship that was first noted histologically and ultrastructurally in 1991.177 Immunohistochemistry has historically not been helpful in confirming the diagnosis of clear cell sarcoma of kidney, but they are usually PAX8 negative.67 A new commercially available BCOR antibody has high sensitivity and specificity for clear cell sarcoma of kidney (and the other tumors harboring these same genetic events).178 One caveat is that a rare subset of synovial sarcomas may show BCOR overexpression.179

Untreated clear cell sarcoma is a very malignant tumor, with a high tendency for relapse and a propensity for skeletal metastases, particularly skull.166 In this regard, it should be noted that skeletal metastases are extraordinarily rare in conventional Wilms tumors. Metastases of clear cell sarcoma also occur to regional lymph nodes, brain, lung, and liver. In contrast to Wilms tumor, these metastases tend to develop after long intervals following the removal of the primary tumor (5 years or more).

The overall survival rate in a series of 351 cases entered in a National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS) trial was 69%. Multivariate analysis showed that treatment with doxorubicin, stage, age at diagnosis, and tumor necrosis were independent prognostic factors. Of note, stage I patients had a 98% survival rate.171

# Rhabdoid Tumor

Rhabdoid tumor of kidney is a distinct aggressive malignancy that is part of a larger family of SMARCB1-associated neoplasms.142,180 Most cases occur in young infants, the median age at diagnosis being 18 months; 80% occur before 2 years of age.181 Some of the cases have resulted in hypercalcemia.182,183

Grossly, rhabdoid tumor is solid, soft, and relatively well circumscribed. Microscopically, it is a monomorphic neoplasm that always involves the medullary region and has a generally diffuse but sometimes alveolar or trabecular pattern of growth. The tumor cells are medium sized and generally round or oval with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli and indistinct cell borders (Fig. 24.13). However, they can also be spindled, prompting the possibility of confusion with mesoblastic nephroma or clear cell sarcoma. The most characteristic feature is the presence of a large cytoplasmic eosinophilic hyaline globule that displaces the nucleus laterally to result in a plasmacytoid or rhabdomyosarcomatous appearance (Fig. 24.14). Ultrastructurally, this globule is made up of a tangle of intermediate filaments.184 Immunohistochemically, there is strong reactivity for vimentin and usually also for keratin, but generally not muscle (i.e. myogenin) or neural markers. It should be remarked that focal rhabdoid features resulting from accumulation of cytoplasmic filaments can be seen in many other renal tumors, including Wilms tumor, mesoblastic nephroma, and RCC.185 Loss of immunohistochemical expression of SMARCB1 (INI1/hSNF5/BAF47) is a feature of great help in the differential diagnosis with other pediatric small cell tumors.186,187 This results from biallelic alteration (deletion or mutation) of the hSNF5/INI1 locus at chromosome 22q11.2.188 Rare tumors retain SMARCB1 expression due to an alternative mutation in SMARCA4/BRG1. In about 15% of the cases, renal rhabdoid carcinoma.181

# Pediatric-Type Cystic Nephroma and DICER1

# Renal Sarcoma

Pediatric cystic nephroma (multilocular cystic nephroma, multilocular cyst) is an uncommon but distinctive lesion that arises in early infancy. While this diagnostic term has previously been applied to tumors in all age groups, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the term be restricted to infants, given that those tumors are genetically distinct and may be associated with a tumor predisposition syndrome (i.e. germline mutation in DICER1).193-195 Clinical manifestations result from the presence of a mass or, not uncommonly, from ureteral obstruction by one of the daughter locules.

Grossly, the lesion is usually solitary, unilateral, and sharply delineated from the uninvolved renal parenchyma.196 The usual size range is between 5 and 15 cm, and the outer surface is coarsely nodular. The cut surface shows a multilocular appearance, the individual cysts measuring from 1 mm to 3 cm or more (Fig. 24.15). The wall of these cysts is thin and sometimes translucent and lacks papillary projections. The fluid within the cavity is usually serous. The cysts do not communicate with each other or with the pelvis. The remaining renal parenchyma is normal. Extension of the lesion beyond the renal capsule may occur.

Microscopically, there are cysts of varying caliber separated by a spindled stroma (Fig. 24.16). The cysts are lined by epithelium that ranges in height from columnar to extremely flat, resembling endothelium and simulating the appearance of lymphangioma. A “hobnail” pattern is common (Fig. 24.17). The stroma between the cysts usually has a fibroblastic, nondescript nature (sometimes immunoreactive for hormone receptors), with variable stromal condensation adjacent to the cyst lining (Fig. 24.18).197 Small well-differentiated tubules may be seen, but the presence of nephroblastomatous elements would preclude the diagnosis of cystic nephroma. The behavior has been very aggressive.198 The overall appearance of this tumor resembles pleuropulmonary blastoma of childhood, of which it may represent the renal counterpart. Recent mutations,192 explaining their reported association with pleuropulmonary blastoma.

Rarely, intrarenal spindle cell sarcomas are identified in pediatric patients and have been described under various names, including embryonal sarcoma and anaplastic sarcoma.198-200 The location may be parenchymal or pelvicalyceal. Microscopically, the common denominator is a spindle cell component containing (either in a diffuse fashion or as multiple foci) varying levels of pleomorphism with some examples showing bizarre pleomorphic cells and atypical mitotic figures. Chondromatous and osteoid foci are sometimes present.

# Intrarenal Neuroblastoma

Neuroblastoma can invade the kidney secondarily from the adrenal or other retroperitoneal site, or it may initially present as a primary intrarenal tumor, and should be classified as outlined in the chapter.

Situ hybridization (FISH), or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the t(11;22) translocation involving EWSR1.208,209 The initial analysis of 146 cases of primary malignant “neuro-epithelial” tumors of the kidney from the NWTS Pathology Center files²¹⁰ and a subsequent review of additional cases²⁰⁵ led the authors to the frustrating conclusion that these represent a diverse group of high-grade tumors which are not always easy to place in a specific category, even after their evaluation with immunohistochemical and molecular genetic tools. We would recommend keeping the diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma pure by requiring molecular confirmation. In our opinion, unusual tumors that do not fit into the Ewing sarcoma family, and for which other specific diagnostic categories are excluded (e.g. Wilms tumor), are best reported descriptively under terms such as “malignant neoplasm with neuroectodermal (or neuroepithelial) differentiation.”

Rarely, other undifferentiated round cell sarcomas have been reported in the kidney, such as those associated with CIC-DUX4 fusion.211,212

Figure 24.19 Gross appearance of Ewing sarcoma, primary in the kidney.

Synovial sarcoma, which is histologically and genetically identical to its soft tissue counterpart, may rarely occur in the kidney. 213,214 It is important to note that there are variable reports of PAX-8 expression on adrenal pathology.²⁰³ When intrarenal, a misdiagnosis of Wilms tumor is likely. This issue is further complicated by the fact that the embryonal tubules of Wilms tumor can simulate rosettes and that true neuroblastic elements can occur in Wilms tumor. Immunohistochemical and molecular genetic evaluation are of help in this differential diagnosis.41,204

# Intrarenal Ewing Sarcoma

Ewing sarcoma can also occur as a primary renal mass. 205,206 Its morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic features are analogous to those at other sites. Most patients are young adults, and the clinical course is very aggressive. 207 Many of the cases are centered in the medullary/pelvic region (Fig. 24.19). The main differential diagnosis is with blastema-predominant Wilms tumor, from which it is distinguished by its positivity for CD99 and its (usual) negativity for WT1. 205 Ideally, the diagnosis should be confirmed by the demonstration by cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

# Metanephric Tumors

Metanephric adenoma tends to occur in young or middle-aged female patients. While more common in adults, metanephric adenoma is described here to include the related forms with a stromal component, which are more common in children. Grossly, they are solid and tan to gray in color. Microscopically, they are mostly composed of tightly packed small back-to-back tubules with minute lumina accompanied by very scanty stroma (Figs. 24.20 and 24.21). 217-219 More elongated branching tubules and areas with papillary architecture are not uncommon. The neoplastic cells are small and basophilic with almost no cytoplasm; nuclear features are bland. The overall appearance is very reminiscent of developing metanephric tubular epithelium. 220 Psammoma bodies are very common.

STATEMENT: Figure 24.21 Papillary pattern of growth of metanephric adenoma. may be numerous. Secondary changes such as hemorrhage or cyst formation are common. Some of these features are also apparent on cytologic examination.²²¹

Immunophenotypically, metanephric adenomas express both nuclear PAX8 and WT1, and cytoplasmic CD57 staining is common.²²² CK7 is negative or only focally positive. Genetically, approximately 90% have BRAF V600E mutations,²²³ and BRAF immunohistochemistry (diffuse cytoplasmic staining) may serve as a surrogate marker.224,225 The genetic features indicative of Wilms tumor and papillary RCC are absent.

The behavior of metanephric adenoma is benign.

Metanephric stromal tumor is a recently described pediatric renal neoplasm, occurring primarily in early childhood. It typically presents grossly as a fibrous lesion centered in the renal medulla that contains smooth-walled cysts. Microscopically, the neoplastic cells are spindle shaped, but admixed epithelioid features occur. The tumor entraps native renal tubules and blood vessels with onion-skin cuffing and myxoid change around each of the structures. Juxtaglomerular cell hyperplasia may also be seen within entrapped glomeruli (which may be associated with hypertension). There may be heterologous differentiation in the form of glia or cartilage and various types of associated vascular alterations (i.e. angiodysplasia). Immunohistochemically, most cases are reactive for CD34. Surgical excision is curative.²²⁶

Metanephric adenofibroma is a biphasic tumor in which an epithelial component similar to that of metanephric adenoma is intimately admixed with a bland spindle cell stroma similar to that of metanephric stromal tumor (Fig. 24.22). 227,228 Ages range from 1 to 36 years, but the mean is 7 years. The spindle cell component commonly expresses CD34 and entraps normal renal structures. The epithelial component has similar morphology and immunophenotype to metanephric adenoma. In some reported cases, part of the epithelial component was indistinguishable from that of Wilms tumor and in others it closely resembled papillary RCC. 227 The behavior of typical metanephric adenofibroma is benign.

# Renal Cell Carcinoma

While MiT family translocation RCCs represent the most common RCC subtype in children, they are fully described in the adult renal neoplasia section since they are more commonly seen in that setting (due to much higher incidence of RCC in adults). Most other subtypes of renal cell carcinoma have also been reported in children and young adults.

# Other Pediatric Tumor Types

Isolated examples of pediatric neoplasms not clearly belonging to any of the previous categories have been described. They include ossifying renal tumor of infancy (presenting as a calcified mass in the renal pelvis and composed of spindle cells in a partially calcified osteoid matrix), 229 intrarenal teratoma (to be distinguished from teratoid Wilms tumor), 230 intrarenal pure yolk sac tumor, 231 and desmoplastic small round cell tumor. 232-234

# Adult Tumors and Tumorlike Conditions

# Renal Cell Carcinoma

# General Features

RCC is generally a tumor of adults (average age at diagnosis: 55–60 years).²³⁵ Many of the RCCs occurring in children have an appearance and behavior equivalent to those developing in adults, 236-239 but a high percentage belong to the MiT family translocation types. 240,241 The male to female ratio of adult RCC is about 2: 1, and the incidence of bilaterality is 1%. Cigarette smoking and high blood pressure are said to increase the risk for development of the disease. 242 The list of diseases, hereditary and non-hereditary, that are associated with increased risk of RCC (including disease specific subtypes) continues to expand.²⁴³

Conditions that may be complicated by RCC are the following:

1. von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) disease. RCC occurs in 50% or more of individuals with this autosomal dominant syndrome, which is also characterized by the presence of CNS (usually cerebellar) and retinal hemangioblastomas; cysts of kidney, liver, and pancreas; clear cell tumors in a variety of sites (including inner ear and paratestis); and pheochromocytomas. 244,245 RCCs (of the clear cell subtype) in these patients tend to be multiple and associated with cysts, some of which show atypical changes in the lining epithelium. 246-248 The cysts, atypical cysts, and renal tumors of these patients have a similar immunohistochemical profile.²⁴⁹ The VHL disease gene, called VHL, has been identified at chromosome 3p25.5. This tumor-suppressor gene is mutated in the germline of affected individuals, and in VHL-associated RCCs it is associated with a subsequent deletion of VHL in the wild-type allele. The marked degree of vascularization that often accompanies RCC (and other VHL-defective tumors, such as

These renal tumors are now regarded as a specific subtype of RCC (i.e. HLRCC associated [or fumarate hydratase deficient] RCC).260,261

1. Hereditary paraganglioma syndrome (germline succinate dehydrogenase mutation). Patients are predisposed to paragangliomas, renal neoplasms, pituitary adenomas, and a unique type of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Recent studies have shown that the renal tumors represent a distinct subtype, described later as “SDH-deficient RCC.” 262-264
2. Tuberous sclerosis. Although the classic renal tumor associated with this neurocutaneous syndrome is angiomyolipoma (AML), RCCs may be encountered, sometimes seen in intimate connection with the former.265,266 While cases of oncocytoma have been described in this setting, the main RCC subtypes seem identical to sporadic tumors classified as “eosinophilic solid and cystic (ESC),” “RCC with angioleiomyomatous stroma,” and a heterogeneous spectrum of oncocytic tumors resembling either chromophobe RCC or hybrid oncocytic tumors (further described under individual RCC subtypes later). 265-267
3. Neuroblastoma. Several cases of RCC developing in children previously treated for neuroblastoma have been reported; however, this seems to be a heterogeneous group of tumors that include post-therapy–related MiT family translocation carcinomas, sporadic type RCCs, and a unique renal neoplasm with “oncocytoid” features that, in our opinion, shares some features with the recently described “ESC” RCC. 268,269
4. PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (germline PTEN mutation) is the molecular diagnostic term used for the disorders that include Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, and a spectrum of other clinical presentations. This syndrome is rarely associated with RCCs with a papillary, clear cell, or chromophobe morphology.270,271
5. Acquired cystic disease of the kidney. Approximately 30%–40% of patients on long-term dialysis develop an acquired form of polycystic renal disease,²⁵² and 3%–7% of these are complicated by the appearance of RCC. 253 Atypical cysts with papillary hyperplasia of the lining epithelium is a consistent feature in these cases and the likely pathogenetic basis for tumor development.²⁵³ While any subtype may be seen in this setting, a subset has unique morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic features described later (see section “Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease Associated Renal Cell Carcinoma”). 254
6. Adult form of polycystic kidney disease (Fig. 24.23). As with the preceding entity, the carcinoma in these cases is accompanied and probably preceded by atypical cysts that begin as foci of papillary epithelial hyperplasia.²⁵⁵ The tumors are frequently multifocal/bilateral and often have papillary or clear cell morphology. 256
7. Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (germline folliculin mutation) is characterized by a constellation of findings that include skin adnexal tumors (fibrofolliculoma), basilar pulmonary cysts with frequent spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal neoplasia.²⁵⁷ The renal tumors are often oncocytic and include oncocytoma, chromophobe RCC, and hybrid oncocytic tumors.²⁵⁸ The hybrid tumors may have a unique appearance with a so-called checkerboard pattern characterized by alternating eosinophilic and clear cells; however, unlike chromophobe RCC, the nuclei are small and almost pyknotic while the cytoplasm is somewhat vacuolated. The background kidney parenchyma may also show renal oncocytosis.²⁵⁹
8. Hereditary leiomyomatosis and RCC syndrome (germline fumarate hydratase mutation) is autosomal dominant and characterized by the presence of cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and RCCs.

# Clinical Features

RCC usually presents with hematuria (59%), flank pain (41%), or as an abdominal mass (45%). However, the combination of these three features, classically regarded as the diagnostic triad of RCC, occurs in only 9% of the patients. 272 Other manifestations are weight loss (28%), anemia (21%), fever (7%), and symptoms caused by a metastatic deposit (10%). Rare systemic/paraneoplastic manifestations include leukemoid reaction, systemic amyloidosis, polyneuromyopathy, gastrointestinal disturbances, hepatosplenomegaly, hypercalcemia, polycythemia, and hepatic dysfunction.²⁷³⁻²⁸²

In general, the investigation of a suspected renal mass begins with CT scan or MRI.²⁸³ With the increasing use of these modalities, the number of incidentally detected RCCs has increased substantially.284,285 In expert hands, core needle biopsy has been shown to provide adequate diagnostic material in about 80% of the cases. 286 Many centers proceed directly to partial nephrectomy without biopsy in surgical candidates; however, as active surveillance of renal mass lesions and local ablation techniques gain acceptance, biopsy rates will likely increase.²⁸⁷

# Subtypes of Renal Cell Carcinoma

Subtyping of RCC has become increasingly complicated since the modern classification was proposed in 1997. Diagnosing specific subtypes is important because each has distinct underlying molecular correlates, unique immunophenotypes, varying biologic potential for aggressive behavior, emerging therapeutic implications, and in some cases important predisposition information for family members. Therefore, each of the specific RCC subtypes is discussed separately to include histology, immunohistochemistry, and any known genetic features.

# Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma

Clear cell RCC is the most common type of RCC, accounting for 65%–70% of all renal cancers. Grossly, most clear cell RCCs are well delineated and centered on the cortex. On occasion, only a small portion is connected with the cortex, the bulk of the tumor appearing as an extrarenal mass. Extension to the renal pelvis occurs only late in the course of the disease. In approximately 5% of the cases, multiple tumor nodules are seen scattered throughout the organ, but in some cases this may represent retrograde venous extension from the dominant tumor.

In a typical case of clear cell RCC, the cut surface shows a solid, golden-yellow tumor, sharply separated from the surrounding tissues by a fibrous pseudocapsule. The common occurrences of hemorrhage, necrosis, calcification, and cystic change result in the variegated grading. In the usual case, the pattern of growth is predominantly solid, with formation of alveolar and acinar patterns of tumor cells separated by a stroma that is characteristically endowed with a prominent network of small, thin-walled blood vessels. This vascular pattern is an important diagnostic criterion, especially for cases with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm.

Microscopically, the tumor cells of clear cell RCC are relatively large, the appearance of the cytoplasm ranging from optically clear to deeply granular, with many transitional forms. Rarely, pseudopapillary architecture may be present. Tumors with extensive regression show large areas of edematous or collagenized stroma that contain a well-formed arborizing vasculature; in difficult cases, low-molecular-weight cytokeratin or EMA immunostains can highlight the subtle population of residual neoplastic cells that mimic histiocytes. Multiple sections usually show diverse patterns within.

In regard to the latter, the most useful positive markers are the coexpression of keratin and PAX-8. It is, however, the negative markers that are of greatest use depending on the circumstance, to wit: (1) in the differential diagnosis with adrenal cortical carcinoma, the fact that clear cell RCC is negative for inhibin, MelanA, and SF-1; (2) in the differential diagnosis with clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, the fact that clear cell RCC is usually negative for keratin 34βE12 and CK7; (3) in the differential diagnosis with clear cell carcinoma of the thyroid, the fact that RCC is negative for thyroglobulin and TTF-1; (4) in the differential diagnosis with mesothelioma the fact that RCC is negative for calretinin, mesothelin, and CK 5/6, and so forth. While we generally find PAX-8 to be the most useful renal epithelial marker based on sensitivity and specificity, the number of tumors that may express PAX-8 must be carefully considered.

The notable feature of the genetic aspects of RCC is that there is a very close relationship with the various morphologic subtypes, which can be investigated by conventional cytogenetics, PCR, FISH, microsatellite analysis, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray, or sequencing techniques. A distinctive abnormality found in most cases of clear cell RCC is alteration of the VHL tumor suppressor, either by a terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3, beginning at 3p13, silencing through promoter methylation, and somatic mutation. Since this abnormality does not characterize other types of RCC, its detection could be utilized to aid in differential diagnosis; however, this is rarely done in routine practice due to the different possible modes of VHL alteration.

While the VHL gene on 3p25–26 is typically implicated (with inactivation of both copies), other tumor suppressor genes on 3p may also play a role, such as KD-M6A, KMM5C, SETD2, and PBRM1. Mutations in BAP1 have been associated with high-grade tumors and poor outcome. The molecular changes have shed light on the pathogenesis of some clinical and morphologic features of clear cell RCC, as well as provided the basis for the design of various targeted therapies.

The VHL gene product is required for degradation of HIF-1α (hypoxia inducible factor α). With loss of VHL protein in clear cell RCC, HIF-1α accumulates, resulting in activation of a variety of...

========================================

hypoxia-inducible genes and hence increased production of their products. These include VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), TGF-α, GLUT-1, metalloproteinases, and erythropoietin.322,339,340 Furthermore, the AKT-mTOR pathway can also affect HIF-1α, since mTOR normally promotes translation of HIF-1α.³³⁹ Targeted therapy may therefore utilize tyrosine kinase inhibitors for VEGF receptor and PDGF receptor (such as sunitinib and sorafenib), inhibitors for mTOR (such as temsirolimus), and/or antibodies targeting VEGF (bevacizumab). 322,339

Clear cell RCC has a high rate of metastatic disease, sometimes years after initial diagnosis. Prognostic factors are discussed later in a separate section.

# Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma

Papillary RCC is the second most common subtype with series typically reporting that it accounts for 15% to 18% of all RCCs. Classification within this category continues to rapidly evolve. It has been proposed that papillary RCC can be further subdivided into two types: type 1, in which the papillae are lined by a single layer of cells with scanty pale cytoplasm; and type 2, in which the papillae are lined by a pseudostratified epithelium composed of cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, typically of higher nuclear grade.341,342 Molecular studies have confirmed the type II category to be a very heterogeneous group of tumors, and one could argue that these should not be combined with type 1 in the classification scheme.³⁴³

Type 1 papillary RCC represents the prototypical papillary RCC. They are more likely than clear cell RCC to be localized to the kidney, but also more likely to be multicentric or bilateral. 344-346 Grossly, the tumors are often encapsulated and the cut surface has a tan-brown appearance; the intracystic papillary growth may mimic extensive necrosis. Microscopically, a thick fibrous capsule is typical, and the individual neoplastic cells line the inner layer of the capsule. Complex papillary formations fill the intracystic space (Fig. 24.28A), often accompanied by prominent stromal infiltration by neutrophils or foamy macrophages. 347,348 The neoplastic cells lining the papillae consist of a single layer of low cuboidal epithelium, often with little cytoplasm (see Fig. 24.28B). Psammoma bodies may be numerous and the nuclear grade is variable. 349,350

Other, histologic patterns of type 1 papillary RCC include solid growth, in which papillae are collapsed together (Fig. 24.29), and the “biphasic squamoid alveolar” pattern (Fig. 24.30). Papillary RCCs may undergo intratumoral hemorrhage and necrosis; intracytoplasmic hemosiderin deposition and cytoplasmic clearing are not uncommon in such foci. In fact, type 1 papillary RCC may undergo near complete infarction leaving only a thick fibrous capsule filled with necrosis and cholesterol granulomas. Numerous sections of the capsule will often reveal foci of residual viable tumor.

Immunohistochemically (and in contrast with clear cell RCC) there is strong expression of keratin 7 and AMACR in type 1 tumors.³⁵¹ According to this classification scheme, it is the type 1 tumors that have the underlying chromosome 7, 17, and Y abnormalities. 352-354 In contrast to clear cell RCC, there is no loss of 3p. Type 1 papillary RCC has a better prognosis than clear cell RCC.344,355 In rare instances, type I papillary RCC is hereditary, associated with germline mutations of the c-MET oncogene, often presenting with hundreds of small tumors.³⁵⁶

Type 2 papillary RCC represents a heterogeneous collection of high-grade RCCs with papillary architecture (Fig. 24.31). Recent molecular studies have shown that MiT family translocation RCCs and RCCs associated with hereditary leiomyomatosis are frequently misclassified as “type 2” papillary RCC. Of the remaining type 2 tumors, different genetic subgroups include sporadic fumarate.

Figure 24.32 Multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential.

# Multilocular Cystic Renal Neoplasm of Low Malignant Potential

These are rare macrocystic renal tumors, representing less than 1% of renal neoplasms, that are composed of thin septa without any macroscopic tumor nodules or expansile growth. Microscopically, the cysts are lined by a layer of clear epithelial cells, but the key diagnostic feature is the presence of small clusters of clear neoplastic cells in the thin walls of the septa (Fig. 24.32).36 The presence of any solid nodules of tumor cells would warrant a diagnosis of clear cell RCC. Genetically, these tumors have 3p alterations similar to clear cell RCC, so they may simply represent an early phase of clear cell. When solid foci of tumor regression are present, the tumors are probably best diagnosed as clear cell RCC.36 If diagnosed using strict histologic criteria with very close gross correlation, multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential follows a benign clinical course.36 It is likely that staging has little prognostic value in these tumors.36 The main differential diagnostic considerations are clear cell RCC, clear cell–papillary RCC, benign renal cortical cysts, and cystic nephroma (mixed epithelial and stromal tumor [MEST]).

Figure 24.31 Renal cell carcinoma, papillary type 2.

# Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma

Chromophobe RCC comprises about 5% of all cases of RCC. It is grossly well circumscribed, solitary, with a homogeneous gray to brown cut surface, typically devoid of hemorrhage or necrosis (Fig. 24.33).36 Microscopically, there is a characteristic broad “alveolar” arrangement of the tumor at low power, but some cases have smaller nests. There are two main histologies: classic (or “plant-cell”) type and eosinophilic variant. In the classic type, the neoplastic cells have sharply defined borders and abundant cytoplasm with very prominent cell membranes (Fig. 24.34).36 The cytoplasm has a pale, acidophilic quality, and there is often a vague clear perinuclear region.37 The eosinophilic variant has more pronounced perinuclear clearing, but less prominent cell membranes (Fig. 24.35). Some cases have mixed features. Calcification is present in nearly half of the cases. The nuclear features, which are critical to diagnosis, are characterized by irregular nuclear membranes, hyperchromasia, and frequent binucleation. In our opinion, these specific nuclear features are both necessary and sufficient for classification as chromophobe RCC.

It should also be realized that papillary RCC (like all other types) can undergo anaplastic or sarcomatoid changes, but rhabdoid differentiation is uncommon.36 Rare cases are associated with multicystic, microcystic, and adenomatous patterns of growth or neuroendocrine-like features (Fig. 24.36).37

the tumor can be recognized in fine-needle aspiration specimens and biopsies.374,375 This cytoplasmic appearance is due to the presence of numerous cytoplasmic microvesicles that are well appreciated by electron microscopy, but this is no longer employed for routine diagnosis.³⁷⁶ These microvesicles stain for Hale colloidal iron; however, the stain is technically difficult to perform and we do not require its use.368,377-379 The number of publications promoting the use of adjunctive immunohistochemistry in the distinction between chromophobe RCC and oncocytoma is overwhelming, to say the least. In our experience, the immunophenotype of cases with prototypical histologic features of chromophobe RCC can be much more heterogenous than would be suggested by the literature. Therefore, we rely almost exclusively on H&#x26;E morphology for this distinction (see section on renal oncocytoma for full discussion on the handling of “difficult to classify” cases).

Based on a recent publication, even expert pathologists’ use of immunohistochemistry and special stains in this setting varies quite dramatically.³⁸⁰ With that caveat, chromophobe RCC is reported to commonly express EMA, CD117, keratin 7, CD9, CD82,³⁸¹ paxillin, parvalbumin,³⁸² claudin-7 and -8,383,384 Ep-Cam (an epithelial adhesion molecule), 385 and E-cadherin, but not N-cadherin or vimentin.³⁸⁶⁻³⁸⁹ A high percentage of chromophobe RCCs have been found to be immunoreactive for CD10 at least focally. 390 It should also be highlighted that, in contrast to most RCC subtypes, at least 20% of chromophobe RCCs are negative for PAX-8. 391,392 Frequent loss of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 10, 13, 17, and 21 has been found by comparative genomic hybridization³⁹³ and microsatellite markers.394,395 Other reported losses include chromosomes 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 18, and Y.

While the important work reported by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed fascinating insights into the biology of chromophobe RCC, the molecular events were very heterogeneous, and a practical diagnostic marker was not identified. 396 Chromophobe RCC can undergo sarcomatoid transformation; as a matter of fact, it may have a greater tendency to this event than many other types.395,397 As a whole, the prognosis of chromophobe RCC is much more favorable than that of clear cell RCC, but distant metastases can develop (particularly liver), especially when the tumors are high stage at presentation. 398,399 The current consensus is that grade does not provide additional prognostic information for chromophobe RCC.

# Clear Cell–Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma

Clear cell–papillary RCC was ﬁrst described by Tickoo et al. within a series of RCCs arising in end-stage kidney disease, but it is now recognized as more common in a sporadic setting. In fact, two large studies have similarly shown that it represents the fourth most common RCC after clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe.

Grossly, clear cell–papillary RCC is circumscribed and often encapsulated. It may be solid, but is often cystic. Microscopically, cystic areas are lined by a single low cuboidal layer of clear cells with areas of papillary tufts lined by similar cells. More solid areas have an admixture of architectural patterns, including tubular, acinar, and nested. The clear cells are cytologically low grade (International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] nuclear grade 1–2), and there is frequently reverse polarity with subnuclear clearing and a linear arrangement of the nuclei (Fig. 24.37). The tubular pattern almost always shows branching. Solid and nested areas may have significant overlap with clear cell carcinoma, but the absence of the dense fibrovascular septa, the linear nuclear arrangement, and the presence of other architectural patterns aid in diagnosis as clear cell–papillary RCC (Fig. 24.38). Tumor cell necrosis and invasion of renal sinus vessels should be absent.

The capsule of the tumor may show smooth muscle metaplasia, but this should not change the classification as clear cell–papillary RCC if other features are typical. Such tumors were originally described as part of the spectrum of “renal angiomyoadenomatous tumor,” but clear cell–papillary RCC is now considered distinct from “RCC with (angio)leiomyomatous stroma.”

Immunophenotypically, these tumors show strong and diffuse immunoreactivity for cytokeratin 7. CD10 and racemase are typically negative, while CA-IX (“cup-like” pattern), PAX-8, and high-molecular-weight keratin are often positive. Nuclear GATA-3 expression has been recently reported. When immunohistochemistry is needed, cytokeratin 7 often provides sufficient support to exclude clear cell subtype (which is negative or shows only focal staining); in fact, the absence of cytokeratin 7 staining should prompt careful reconsideration of a clear cell–papillary diagnosis. Cytokeratin 7 stains should be evaluated in solid foci because cyst-lining epithelial cells of many tumor types show strong immunoreactivity. Genetically, our practice would generally regard the presence of intracystic features as significant.

When diagnosed by strict criteria, no recurrence or metastasis has been reported in clear cell–papillary RCC; therefore, the differential diagnostic distinction from clear cell RCC and a subset of MiT family translocation RCC is critical. Other less critical distinctions, such as multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential and atypical renal cysts, may be difficult and somewhat subjective. In our experience, papillary RCC rarely enters into consideration. It is important to note that some low-grade clear cell RCCs have foci reminiscent of clear-cell papillary RCC, often due to linear alignment of nuclei. Studies have shown that tumors with such mixed features have genetic features and a clinical outcome supporting clear cell subtype. Rare subsets of MiT family translocation carcinomas (specifically fusion types SFPQ-TFE3 and NONO-TFE3) may also mimic clear cell–papillary RCC (or possibly multilocular cystic renal neoplasm) based on suprabasal nuclear palisading and subnuclear vacuoles (Fig. 24.39).

papillary excrescences as favoring clear cell–papillary RCC over multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential. The distinction of an atypical renal cyst (with focal papillary excrescences lined by clear cells) from a macrocystic clear cell–papillary may be very subjective. In the presence of papillary tufts within multiple cystic locules of the same lesion, we would favor clear cell–papillary RCC.

Finally, some patients with VHL disease have tumors with morphologic features similar to clear cell–papillary RCC; these are controversial, but in our opinion they are best interpreted as clear cell RCC, given their association with 3p abnormality.

# MiT Family Translocation Renal Cell Carcinomas

An exciting new chapter of renal tumor pathology opened with the discovery that some tumors are associated with nonrandom chromosomal alterations involving members of the microphthalmia transcription factor subfamily. The better studied of these are those involving region Xp11.2, resulting in fusion of the TFE3 gene. Most of the initial cases were reported in young people; while they represent approximately 40% of pediatric RCCs, they can also develop in adults. Microscopically, the overall features are typically those of an RCC but are very heterogeneous. Papillary structures may be prominent, and the tumor cells can be either clear or have a markedly granular eosinophilic cytoplasm; however, some cases are more solid and clear cell predominant, closely mimicking clear cell RCC. Admixed psammoma bodies may be abundant. There are numerous fusion partners reported, some correlations having been found between the type of gene fusion and the tumor morphology. Aberrant increased nuclear immunoreactivity for TFE3 is consistently detected in these cases, but many labs find the antibody technically challenging to use and prefer FISH testing (as do we). These tumors usually express PAX2 and PAX8, but do not usually express MiTF. One specific fusion (RBM10-TFE3) may be difficult to detect by FISH due to cryptic inversion.

Another, even less common translocation-associated RCC involves t(6;11), the resulting fusion affecting the TFEB gene at 6p21.

Microscopically, these tumors show nested and acinar-like areas of cells with clear or granular acidophilic cytoplasm with round nuclei. Some cases show a biphasic pattern with a population of smaller cells surrounding eosinophilic basement membrane–like material. They may be difficult to morphologically distinguish from Xp11.2-related tumors, and they may express HMB45 or Melan-A. It is clear that the subject is rapidly evolving and that additional variations, both at the morphologic and the molecular genetic level, are being described. Case in point, aggressive RCCs with TFEB amplification are recently described.

Rare hybrid melanotic tumors showing mixed features of MiT family translocation carcinoma and AML are also described.

# Collecting Duct Carcinoma

Collecting duct carcinoma constitutes less than 1% of all RCCs under current criteria. These tumors are centered in the medulla, have destructive infiltrative growth often with surrounding desmoplastic reaction, and are almost always high stage at diagnosis. Common histologic patterns include tubulopapillary, solid sheets, nests, cords, cribriform, and infiltrating glands or elongated tubules. Sarcomatoid differentiation may also be present. Atypical changes in the adjacent ducts (i.e. dysplasia) may be seen, but distinction from reactive tubular changes is often subjective.

Genetic profile information is limited for collecting duct carcinoma because of its rarity and the evolving diagnostic criteria that now further restricts its diagnosis. Likewise, immunophenotypic data.

have historically varied, likely due to inclusion of a broad spectrum of tumors in the past.

The behavior of collecting duct carcinoma is generally very aggressive, many of the patients having distant metastases at the time of presentation.441,442 Most importantly, collecting duct carcinoma should be a diagnosis of exclusion. Urothelial carcinoma (with or without glandular differentiation), metastatic carcinoma from a distant site, renal medullary carcinoma, and RCC with fumarate hydratase mutation should be carefully considered because each is more common. Additional sections from the collecting system may be most helpful in distinction from urothelial carcinoma, but immunohistochemistry may be needed if no definitive urothelial precursor lesion is identified. We would generally require at least a PAX8-positive/p63-negative phenotype for this diagnosis. Unfortunately, at least 25% of upper tract urothelial carcinoma express PAX8, so even immunohistochemical distinction may be difficult in some cases. Nuclear SMARCB1 should be retained, which is a distinguishing feature from medullary carcinoma. 443-445 Fumarate hydratase (FH) loss by immunohistochemistry and/or genetic counseling/testing may be needed to exclude fumarate hydratase–deficient RCC (hereditary leiomyomatosis and RCC syndrome). 446

# Fumarate Hydratase–Deficient Renal Cell Carcinoma

clearing may be present only focally. Many tumors previously regarded as “de-differentiated tubulocystic carcinoma” represent FH-deficient RCC (Fig. 24.45).⁴⁴⁹ Finally, rare cases, especially in younger patients, may not have fully developed features and can overlap with lower-grade oncocytic tumors (Fig. 24.46).⁴⁵⁰ Immunohistochemistry can play an important role in this diagnosis, as tumors typically lose cytoplasmic expression for FH (but not in all cases). Overexpression of modified cysteine (S-(2-succino)cysteine) may also be helpful, but the antibody is not currently available from a commercial source.⁴⁴⁶ A recent study from the TCGA reported that a subset of tumors with papillary morphology have somatic mutations in FH, however, it is no longer appropriate to diagnose or refer to these tumors as the latter. Unlike other hereditary renal neoplasia syndromes, patients may present with only a single unilateral mass due to low penetrance. Macroscopically, tumors are very heterogeneous with variable cystic and solid appearance; in some cases background renal cortical cysts can be seen. Microscopically, the classic pattern is papillary with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and large nucleoli with surrounding peri-nucleolar halos (Fig. 24.43).²⁶¹ Other patterns include tubular, tubulocystic, solid, and cribriform, with admixtures being common (Fig. 24.44).261,446,448

# Renal Medullary Carcinoma

Medullary carcinoma is a rare malignant renal neoplasm occurring most commonly in young patients of African descent (typically 20–30 years of age) with sickle cell trait, but it is rarely seen with other hemoglobinopathies.452,453 It is centered in the medulla, and is microscopically heterogeneous with mixed morphologic patterns.

Figure 24.46 Fumarate hydratase–deficient renal cell carcinoma with deceptive “low-grade” appearance.

Grossly, its appearance has been described as spongy and “bubble wrap.”⁴⁶² Microscopically, there are variably sized cystically dilated tubules lined by a single layer of eosinophilic epithelium with a cuboidal, flat, or hobnail appearance (Fig. 24.48). The nuclei are often enlarged with prominent nucleoli. The individual cysts are separated by a scant fibrous stroma. The prognosis tends to be favorable.⁴⁶² While a subset of cases with high-grade areas showing solid or destructive growth are described under the term “de-differentiated tubulocystic carcinoma,” many of these represent fumarate hydratase–deficient RCC. 449,464,465 While there has been suggestion of a genetic relationship to papillary RCC, this remains controversial and no distinct genetic signature has been reported for tubulocystic carcinoma.466,467

A separate but seemingly very rare renal neoplasm with a VCL-ALK fusion has recently been described in children with sickle cell trait. This VCL-ALK fusion–associated RCC is distinct from renal medullary carcinoma with a unique spindled to polygonal eosinophilic cell population containing conspicuous intracytoplasmic vacuoles. Unlike renal medullary carcinoma, these have followed an indolent clinical course.⁴⁵⁹⁻⁴⁶¹

# Mucinous Tubular and Spindle Cell Carcinoma

Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma (MTSCC) is a unique type of low-grade RCC. Microscopically, the tumor is composed of an admixture of spindle cells and elongated tubules lined by bland cuboidal cells with variable amounts of myxoid/mucinous stroma (Fig. 24.49). Cases containing scanty mucin (“mucin-poor”) can be easily misdiagnosed, the presence of a spindle cell component being an important clue for their correct identification. Focal neuroendocrine features have been occasionally found. The immunohistochemical profile of MTSCC is similar to that of papillary RCC.

# Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease–Associated Renal Cell Carcinoma

This neoplasm is seen only in patients with acquired cystic kidney disease related to dialysis. Patients with acquired cystic kidney disease are at a high risk for developing RCC of any subtype. 253,401,479 The diagnosis of “acquired cystic kidney disease–associated RCC” should be reserved for cases with unique and specific histologic features.401,480,481 The tumors often have macrocystic growth, but solid and papillary architecture is also frequent. The cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells is typically eosinophilic, and prominent nucleoli are common. Two characteristic features include intratumoral oxalate crystals and a unique sieve-like architecture characterized by inter- and intracellular “lumina” separated by very thin strands of cytoplasm (Fig. 24.50). The background kidney, in addition to acquired cystic disease, may contain cysts with atypical papillary proliferations. Immunophenotypically, these RCCs are often negative (or only focally positive) for cytokeratin 7, but they often express AMACR.

# Eosinophilic Solid and Cystic Renal Cell Carcinoma

ESC RCC is an emerging subtype of renal neoplasia that was formally described in a series of tuberous sclerosis–associated RCCs²⁶⁵; however, it is now recognized to occur more frequently in a sporadic setting.483,484 The sporadic tumors appear to occur exclusively in women with a wide age range. Grossly, these tumors are often tan with mixed solid and macrocytic appearance (Fig. 24.54). Histologically, the neoplastic cells are characterized by abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, prominent granular cytoplasmic stippling (said to resemble leishmaniasis), and large round to oval nuclei with prominent nucleoli.

# Succinate Dehydrogenase–Deficient Renal Cell Carcinoma

This recently described subtype of RCC has distinct morphologic features, but is defined by loss of cytoplasmic SDHB expression by immunohistochemistry.²⁶²⁻²⁶⁴ It is almost always associated with germline mutations in an SDH gene (most commonly SDHB) and occurs in a younger age range (mean, 38 years). Because of the syndromic association, patients may have a history of paraganglioma, SDH-deficient GIST, or pituitary adenoma. Grossly, the tumors are well circumscribed with tan-brown or red color; cystic areas may be seen. Morphologically, the neoplastic cells of SDH-deficient RCC have eosinophilic cytoplasm and are arranged in solid, nested, or tubular architecture, and cystic areas are common. The individual cells are monomorphic with round, cytologically bland nuclei. The most helpful diagnostic feature is the presence of an intracytoplasmic vacuole or inclusion that contains eosinophilic material, the consistency of which varies from pale and wispy to densely eosinophilic (Fig. 24.51). The tumor has a rounded, well-delineated border but commonly entraps normal renal tubules.

While these typical morphologic patterns are most common, rare tumors show high-grade transformation in which the inclusions are focal and more difficult to appreciate. These cases show more cytologic atypia, denser cytoplasm, and increased mitotic activity and may invade the renal sinus (Fig. 24.52). Frank sarcomatoid change is also reported. Immunophenotypically, reactivity for CD117 and cytokeratin 7 is very rare, but PAX8 and kidney-specific cadherin are consistently positive. By definition, SDHB immunostains show loss of cytoplasmic reactivity in the neoplastic cells, while internal intratumoral blood vessels or entrapped renal tubules are positive (Fig. 24.53). SDH-deficient RCCs with typical morphologic features most commonly follow an indolent course, but metastases may occur many years after initial diagnosis (~11% of patients). Cases with high-grade transformation have an aggressive clinical course.

discussed previously, it is our observation that “oncocytoid RCC following neuroblastoma” (when MiT family translocation carcinomas are excluded) seems to have many similarities with ESC RCC. 268,269

# Renal Cell Carcinoma, Unclassified

Some RCCs do not precisely fit one of the well-described subtypes and are designated “RCC, unclassified type.”⁴⁸⁵ Most of these tumors are large, high grade, and high stage; however, a rare subset of low grade RCCs do not fit a distinct subtype and might be considered “unclassified.” In such cases, it is important to comment on the low grade nature of the tumor, since most urologists equate “unclassified RCC” with very high risk disease. Immunohistochemistry with PAX8 may be useful to confirm renal epithelial origin, but urothelial markers (p63 and high-molecular-weight keratin) are also helpful since up to 25% of upper tract urothelial carcinoma express PAX8, sometimes diffusely. Recent studies suggest distinct molecular subtypes can be identified. 486

# Other Types

Rare low-grade RCCs made up of well-differentiated, branching tubular glands lined by clear cells with abundant cytoplasm and surrounded and closely intermingled with abundant smooth muscle bundles have been described under various names (Fig. 24.56).⁴⁸⁷⁻⁴⁹³ When clear cell–papillary RCCs are carefully separated from this group, it is thought that this represents a distinct set of clear cell–like renal neoplasms with a more indolent clinical course, currently listed as a WHO provisional entity under the name “RCC with (angio) leiomyomatous stroma.” Unlike clear cell RCC, these tumors have strong and diffuse reactivity for CK7. Recent sequencing studies identified a subset with mutation in the TCEB1 gene, but not all cases have this alteration. 492 Importantly, they do not show 3p abnormalities.³³⁷ Interestingly, a subset of RCCs in patients with tuberous sclerosis have an identical morphology; therefore, we recommend a careful evaluation of the background kidney for AML tumorlets.⁴⁹⁶ Based on the limited data available, these tumors seem to have an indolent clinical course (with no reported metastases) when carefully separated from clear cell RCC.

Other peculiar forms of RCC have been recently described, including a type closely simulating the appearance of a thyroid follicular carcinoma.⁴⁹⁴⁻⁴⁹⁶ Additionally, renal neoplasms with ALK translocations are reported (separate from the VCL-ALK fusion tumors), but classification of these tumors is still evolving.

# Spread and Metastases

Because of the importance of subtype, most general RCC data are heavily driven by the most common subtype, clear cell RCC. Approximately one-third of RCCs are found to invade perinephric fat and/or regional lymph nodes at the time of operation. Invasion of the main renal vein used to be a common finding, but now it is seen less frequently, likely due to earlier imaging detection. From the renal vein, the tumor may extend into the inferior vena cava and occasionally even into the right atrium. RCC, like Wilms tumor, can invade the renal sinus (the adipose tissue compartment located within the confines of the kidney and containing numerous veins and lymphatics), a fact which is likely to increase the risk for metastatic spread. As a matter of fact, it has been claimed that the renal sinus is the principal pathway of invasion of RCC and the explanation for the rare cases of tumor-related death in patients with small tumors. Therefore, very careful gross examination and sampling of the renal sinus are critical.

Satellite tumors, which may represent intrarenal tumor spread or independent primaries, are seen in approximately 6% of the cases. Approximately one-third of patients with RCC already have distant metastases at the time they seek medical attention. The most common sites of distant metastases are the lung and skeleton. The bones most often involved are the pelvis and femur, but there is also a predilection for the sternum, scapula, and small bones of the hands and feet. Metastases can also develop in the adrenal gland, liver, skin, soft tissue, central nervous system, ovary, and almost any other site. RCC is actually notorious (together with malignant melanoma and choriocarcinoma) for metastasizing to the most unusual places, such as the nasal cavity, oral cavity, larynx, parotid, thyroid, heart, bladder, testis, prostate, and pituitary gland. These metastases are often solitary, at least at the clinical level. Even at autopsy, 8% of the patients have metastatic involvement of only one or two organs. Because of this and the fact that the primary tumor is often clinically silent, these metastases tend to be confused with primary tumors of the organs in which they lodge. That can be the case when RCC metastasizes to the ovary, and even more so when it metastasizes to the contralateral adrenal gland. In these instances, detection of EMA, keratin, and PAX-8 positivity favors a diagnosis of RCC. An additional source of misinterpretation stems from the fact that sometimes these metastases develop years or decades after the removal of the primary tumor. Several cases have been documented in which these metastases have undergone spontaneous regression.

# Prognosis

The overall 5-year survival rate for RCC is approximately 70%. The prognosis is related to several clinicopathologic parameters.

1. RCC subtype. The prognostic significance associated with the various microscopic variants of RCC is discussed in connection with those variants.
2. Staging. In patients who do not have distant metastases at diagnosis, stage on the basis of surgical findings is one of the strongest prognostic factors. The AJCC 8th edition bases staging on tumor size and spread beyond the kidney. Based on numerous studies by Bonsib, it is clear that the main route of RCC extension outside of the kidney parenchyma involves the blood vessels of the renal sinus. While renal vein involvement is typically easy to recognize grossly, very careful gross inspection of the tumor/stromal interface where tumor abuts fat is critical.
3. Distant metastases. The presence of distant metastasis at the time of operation is, not surprisingly, the single most important unfavorable prognostic parameter.
4. Tumor size. Size of the primary tumor relates to prognosis for the very small (&#x3C;4 cm) and the very large (>10 cm) tumors but not for those between these extremes, which represent the large majority. For such tumors (4–10 cm), size seems to be a.

# Therapy

The primary treatment of RCC is surgical excision. While transabdominal or thoracoabdominal radical nephrectomy with removal of the entire kidney, surrounding fat, Gerota fascia, and adrenal gland has historically been preferred, a laparoscopic approach with only a segmental resection of the kidney is now more common and yields long-term results comparable to those of open surgery. No consistent benefits have yet been demonstrated for administration of adjunctive radiation therapy or chemotherapy; neoadjuvant therapy is sometimes utilized in select cases in an attempt to reduce tumor size prior to surgery. RCCs that are bilateral, that develop in the setting of VHL disease, or that occur in a solitary kidney are treated with partial nephrectomy, if technically feasible. Some authors have proposed this approach for small RCCs in general.

Continuous and therefore relative variable. 550 Out of necessity, an arbitrary size cutoff is needed, and this cutoff has been established to be 7 cm between T1 and T2 tumors in the 2016 TNM staging system; however, it has been suggested that different size cutoffs might be more predictive of the survival of stage I patients after radical nephrectomy. 551,552 As Bonsib has emphasized, increasing tumor size correlates very highly with invasion of the renal sinus, such that it is difficult to identify a pT2 clear cell RCC after very careful gross evaluation. 543

1. Renal vein invasion. Gross invasion of the renal vein has been regarded as a poor prognostic sign and therefore constitutes a criterion for surgical staging. 541,549 Microscopic lymphovascular invasion has also been found to be an important predictor of relapse, but this has been variably defined. 553-555
2. Microscopic grade. Nuclear grade of the tumor as determined in microscopic sections is an important predictor of survival in clear cell carcinoma (but not in chromophobe cell carcinoma, and possibly some rare variants as noted earlier). 400,556-559 It is strongly correlated with surgical staging, but it also maintains statistical validity independently from it. 547,560 Grading is performed using the WHO/ISUP grading system, which has proven utility in clear cell and papillary RCC (see Table 24.3). 559,561,562 Rhabdoid and sarcomatoid differentiation have now been incorporated into the grading system and are regarded as grade 4. Some have advocated for the use of nuclear morphometry to further refine the criteria for nuclear grading, but this is not standard practice. 563-565
3. Necrosis. Coagulative tumor necrosis has been shown to be a strong predictor of outcome, and there has been a proposal to integrate necrosis into the grading system. 566-568

# Adenomas

Renal papillary adenomas, defined as minute cortical foci of tubular or (more commonly) papillary epithelium, are present in approximately 20% or more of adult kidneys; most of them measure 1–3 mm in diameter and by the latest WHO definition are less than 1.5 cm, lack a tumor capsule, and are no more than nucleolar grade 2. ⁵⁶⁹⁻⁵⁷² The cytoplasm of the proliferating cells is typically acidophilic rather than clear and not particularly abundant. ⁵⁷³ Psammoma bodies may be present. Papillary adenomas are particularly common and numerous in end-stage kidneys in patients on long-term dialysis (renal adenomatosis). 574,575 Since these adenomas share the same cytogenetic findings as type 1 papillary RCC, they likely represent early forms of the disease without metastatic potential. In contrast, other subtypes of renal neoplasia are no longer divided into adenomas and carcinomas based on size, such that small clear cell RCCs are still diagnosed as carcinoma.

# Oncocytoma, “Difficult to Classify” Oncocytic Tumors, and Oncocytosis

The diagnosis of renal oncocytoma represents one of the more problematic and controversial topics in renal neoplasia classification today. ³⁸⁰ Renal oncocytomas reportedly make up 5%–9% of all primary nonurothelial epithelial renal neoplasms; however, this number depends largely on the diagnostic criteria employed. ⁵⁷⁶ Our diagnostic approach is to identify three histologic groups of low-risk oncocytic tumors: classic prototypical oncocytoma, classic prototypical chromophobe RCC, and oncocytic tumors that are “difficult to classify.” This section describes classic oncocytoma, followed by comments on handling problematic cases. Grossly, renal oncocytoma is typically solid and mahogany brown, often has a central stellate scar, and can reach large sizes (Fig. 24.58). ⁵⁷⁷ They can be multicentric and bilateral. ⁵⁷⁸ Invasion of the perirenal tissues or renal vein may be encountered. 576,579-582 Some of these gross features (particularly the central scar) have been used to distinguish oncocytomas from RCC on CT scan, but the level of accuracy is poor. ⁵⁸³ Microscopically, oncocytomas are composed entirely of cells with abundant acidophilic granular cytoplasm, growing in a nesting (“alveolar”) or tubular fashion (Fig. 24.59). In some foci, nests and tubules often “float” in an edematous stroma. The nuclei of oncocytoma cells are usually small, round, and regular (Fig. 24.60). 584 Pockets of “degenerative type” nuclear atypia can occur, and some scattered binucleate cells may be present. 585,586 Psammoma bodies can be present, most of them in an intraluminal location. A variant of oncocytoma has been described composed of small cells (i.e. “oncoblasts”), which can easily be misinterpreted. 587,588 Renal tumors with oncocytic cytoplasm and a predominant papillary pattern should probably be placed with the papillary RCCs. ⁵⁸⁹ Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells express pancytokeratin, low-molecular-weight keratins, CD117, S-100A1 protein, 590 and E-cadherin, but show only focal or no expression.

A, This tumor has more variability in nuclear size with multiple nucleoli, but nuclei remain relatively round with no perinuclear clearing. B, This case has very prominent and consistent macronucleoli. Other foci showed solid growth. Such tumors have significant variability in diagnosis, even among experts.

Figure 24.61 Perinuclear halos, binucleation, and “koilocytotic atypia” are features of a prototypical chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Chromophobe RCC have wrinkled, raisin-like hyperchromatic nuclei, whereas those of oncocytoma tend to be perfectly round. As stated before, the presence of well-developed perinuclear halos and/or irregular nuclear membranes with frequent binucleation are sufficient for classification as chromophobe RCC.

Reactivity for vimentin. Cytokeratin 7 is usually negative or only positive in scattered cells; however, entrapped tumor nests within the central scar (often associated with cytoplasmic clearing) have stronger expression of cytokeratin 7. Hale colloidal iron is typically negative. Ultrastructurally, packing of the cytoplasm by mitochondria is the most striking feature. Cytogenetically, oncocytomas lack the 3p abnormalities of clear cell RCC and display different chromosomal alterations, particularly loss of chromosome 1, rearrangements of 11q13, and deletion of chromosome 14.

If strict morphologic criteria are employed, the overwhelming majority of oncocytomas will be cured by excision regardless of size and/or the presence of atypical microscopic features such as vascular invasion or perirenal fat infiltration. Only exceptional cases of well-documented renal oncocytomas have been reported to metastasize.

The main differential diagnosis of renal oncocytoma is with the eosinophilic variant of chromophobe RCC, succinate dehydrogenase–deficient RCC, and less commonly epithelioid AML. The cells of these cases maintain round nuclear contours without perinuclear clearing (i.e. not classic chromophobe) but have greater variability in nuclear size, greater degree of irregular nuclear chromatin, and variable macronucleoli.

has been shown to predict behavior in such tumors. This approach avoids arbitrarily dividing some cases into either a benign or malignant category. Therefore, we prefer to simply utilize the diagnostic term “oncocytic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential,” but other similar terms have been applied. While we have seen extremely rare liver metastases in such cases (far less than 1% based on several hundred cases), it is our anecdotal experience that the vast majority behave in a benign fashion.

As alluded to in the section on unclassified RCC, rare low grade RCCs may have significant overlap with this oncocytic spectrum of neoplasia. We generally reserve the rare diagnosis of “RCC, low-grade oncocytic type” for cases with sheet-like growth and obvious mitotic activity, but without nuclear features of chromophobe RCC.

Oncocytosis is the term proposed for a condition characterized by the presence of innumerable oncocytic nodules in one or both kidneys, usually associated with the presence of a dominant nodule (Fig. 24.63). The disease can affect adults and children, and many cases are likely related to Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. Microscopically, the oncocytic tubules intermingle with the normal parenchyma and may be associated with diffuse oncocytic change in the renal tubules and oncocytic cortical cysts. The larger oncocytic nodules/tumors show morphologic features reminiscent of both oncocytoma and chromophobe RCC, but often show immunohistochemical and cytogenetic profiles distinct from them.

Stage at presentation is the most important factor in determining outcome. It is important for a metastasis from another anatomic site (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) to be excluded clinically.

# Neuroendocrine Tumors

Small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the kidney (or other high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas) with features similar to those of the lung have been described. They show evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation ultrastructurally and immunohistochemically. These should be distinguished from urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis with neuroendocrine differentiation. The behavior of the few reported cases has been very aggressive.

Carcinoid tumor (well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm), which should be sharply segregated from small cell carcinoma, has been reported in a pure form and as a component of cystic teratoma. Microscopically, the tumor cells are well differentiated at the morphologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural levels. The pattern of growth is often trabecular (and therefore similar to that seen in rectal carcinoid and in the carcinoid component of strumal carcinoid of the ovary), but a wide range of appearances has been documented, including nesting (insular) and glandular. The cytoplasm of the tumor cells may have an oncocytic quality.

These “atrophic kidney-like tumors” have all been reported as “thyroid-like follicular RCC,” which we believe is a different lesion. The follicles are lined by an atrophic lining epithelium, and the lumina may contain “sloughed” cells. Variable loose to collagenized stroma is present, and psammoma bodies or more amorphous calcifications are numerous.

Figure 24.64 “Atrophic Kidney-Like Tumor.” A, Cystically dilated follicles of various sizes are typical, with admixed smaller tubules. B, Follicles are lined by a flattened epithelium, and psammoma bodies and amorphous calcifications are present.

# Angiomyolipoma

AML has undergone a remarkable transformation, from a rare and rather pedestrian tumor type restricted to the kidney to a biologically fascinating and morphologically heterogeneous entity that can occur in a wide variety of extrarenal sites, including liver, pelvic region, retroperitoneum (unconnected to the kidney), uterus, somatic soft tissues, large bowel, nasal cavity, and bone. This family of phenotypically similar tumors is now collectively known as PEComa, which include lymphangiomyoma(tosis) of lung and lymph nodes because of the admixture of yellow areas (lipid rich) and hemorrhagic areas (vessels). Capsular invasion is present in one-fourth of the cases, and there can be extension into the perirenal soft tissues.

Most patients are adults. The tumor may be found incidentally or result in retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which can be massive and even fatal. Approximately one-third of the patients with renal AML suffer from tuberous sclerosis, the incidence being higher if the tumors are multiple or bilateral. It has been estimated that approximately 80% of the patients with the complete or severe form of tuberous sclerosis have renal AMLs, and it has been shown that patients with the closely related genetic disease known as TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome also have an increased incidence of renal AML.

In some cases, the appearance of AML on ultrasonography and CT scan is highly characteristic, and the diagnosis can be confirmed by fine-needle aspiration or needle biopsy, supplemented by immunocytochemistry as needed. The gross appearance of the tumor depends on the relative amounts of the various components and may closely simulate RCC.

Figure 24.65: A and B, Gross appearances of angiomyolipoma of kidney.

Figure 24.66: Typical Renal Angiomyolipoma.

Some epithelioid AMLs may have marked cytologic atypia that closely mimics a poorly differentiated RCC. Multicentric microscopic foci are common and suggest tuberous sclerosis; exceptionally, they may be seen involving the glomeruli. In some cases, the AML proliferation is accompanied by cysts lined by cuboidal to hobnail cells resting on a cellular spindle cell stroma with a cambium layer-like appearance.

respects from the “conventional” PEComas lacking these molecular features.⁶⁷⁷ AMLs in which spindle cells with a smooth muscle appearance predominate may mimic leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas, or GISTs (Fig. 24.69). 666,678 Lipid-rich AMLs, in which the adipose tissue is predominant, can be easily confused with an atypical lipomatous tumor (well-differentiated liposarcoma). It should be highlighted that AMLs may express MDM-2 by immunohistochemistry (an adjunctive test for atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma); therefore, FISH evaluation for MDM-2 amplification is more useful in this specific context 679 Highly pleomorphic AMLs rich in epithelioid cells closely resemble RCC.⁶⁸⁰⁻⁶⁸² AMLs composed of monomorphic epithelioid cells with homogeneous acidophilic cytoplasm may be mistaken for oncocytomas. 683-685

The treatment of renal AML is surgical, and excision is usually curative.⁶⁸⁶ However, cases resulting in death from massive local recurrence are on record.687 It is also now abundantly clear that AML is capable of distant metastases; however, the regional lymph node involvement that sometimes accompanies renal AML is an expression of multicentricity rather than true embolic metastases. 688-690 Cases with indisputable metastatic spread in the form of huge retroperitoneal deposits or nodules in the lung and other organs have been documented.⁶⁹¹⁻⁶⁹⁴ Practically all of these biologically malignant cases had highly atypical epithelioid features morphologically, which leads to the question as to whether it is possible to make a diagnosis of malignant AML on morphologic grounds. 695,696 It is obvious that a potential for malignant behavior cannot be excluded for AMLs with “aggressive” morphologic features.682,697 According to a recent study, presence of three or more of the following features is predictive of malignant behavior: (1) ≥70% atypical epithelioid cells (polygonal cells with prominent nucleoli and nuclear size exceeding twice the size of adjacent nuclei); (2) ≥2 mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields; (3) atypical mitotic figures; and (4) necrosis. 696

# Juxtaglomerular Cell Tumor

Patients with juxtaglomerular cell tumor usually present clinically with hypertension because of excessive renin production,⁶⁹⁸ but some cases are nonfunctioning.⁶⁹⁹ Most patients are adult, but cases have also been reported in children. 700 Grossly, all reported cases have been unilateral and solitary. Most have been less than 3 cm in diameter but occasional examples have reached 8 cm.⁷⁰¹ They are solid and well circumscribed, with a gray-white to light yellow cut surface.

CD34 and CD117 and show focal staining for smooth muscle actin.⁷⁰⁶ Ultrastructurally, adrenergic nerve terminals are seen in contact with the tumor cells, which have various types of secretory granules, some of them containing a typical rhomboid crystalline material thought to be renin protogranules (Fig. 24.71).704,707-709 Cytogenetically, some recurrent chromosome imbalances have been reported.710,711 All but one of the reported cases have behaved in a benign fashion,⁶⁹⁹ but some patients have remained hypertensive following nephrectomy. 701,712 It should be noted that renin secretion can be associated with other renal and extrarenal neoplasms, such as RCC, Wilms tumor, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 713-715

MEST is the preferred diagnostic term applied to biphasic tumors, generally occurring in middle-aged and older women, that have been called cystic nephroma, MEST, or REST in adults. 716,717 Several recent studies have shown that the similarities, overlaps, and hybrid forms at the clinical, morphologic, phenotypic, and molecular levels are such as to suggest that cystic nephroma and MEST are two different manifestations of the same basic process. 717-720 As discussed in the section on pediatric renal neoplasia, the name cystic nephroma is now preferred for the pediatric cases that often have DICER1 mutations and frequent syndromic association. MEST may be solid and cystic and may bulge into the renal pelvis. Microscopically, the spindle cell proliferation in between the individual cysts resembles ovarian stroma (Fig. 24.72), including the expression of hormone receptors.

The epithelial component is, for the most part, is similar to cystic nephroma (and therefore consistent with renal ductal epithelium, also at the immunohistochemical and ultrastructural level 721), but is more heterogeneous and may exhibit features suggestive of müllerian-type differentiation, including epithelium of endometrioid, tubal, clear cell, and squamous cell type. In addition, the epithelial component may be more predominant than typically seen in pediatric cases (Fig. 24.73). Cases with great predominance of the stromal or adipose component can be confused with leiomyomas or AMLs. 722 The behavior is generally benign, although a few histologically malignant examples have been reported. 723,724

produces prostaglandins and is believed to be involved in the regulation of intrarenal blood pressure. 726 The tumors are asymptomatic and invariably found incidentally as minute (usually 3 mm or less) white nodules in the midportion of the medullary pyramids. 727 Microscopically, they are composed of small, stellate, or polygonal cells in a loose stromal background, with entrapped tubules at the periphery.

The rare renal leiomyoma is usually located in the cortex or capsule but may also arise in association with hilar blood vessels.668,728 True leiomyomas occur almost exclusively in women. They may represent an incidental histologic finding at surgery or, as with many tumors, an incidental radiographic finding.⁷²⁹ In our opinion, many “leiomyomas” reported in the literature represent “lipid-poor” AMLs that closely resemble smooth muscle.668,730 Immunophenotypically, strong and diffuse desmin expression and absence of cathepsin-K is most helpful since most AMLs show the opposite pattern. 668

Although reported in the literature, the diagnosis of a renal lipoma should be met with great suspicion. 731,732 Before the diagnosis is made, alternative (and more likely) possibilities should be considered: lipid-rich AML or atypical lipomatous tumor of the retroperitoneum (some of which are centered in the perirenal region and which can look very “lipoma-like”). Pelvic/parapelvic lipomatosis could also be considered.

Primary hemangioblastomas have been reported in the kidney. Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) has been seen involving the renal parenchyma or the renal capsule, sometimes in association with hypoglycemia.⁷⁴⁸⁻⁷⁵⁰ Many of the cases historically reported as renal hemangiopericytoma are now considered SFT. 751 As in other sites, most SFTs are benign, with occasional examples behaving aggressively.⁷⁵²

Benign peripheral nerve tumors of both schwannoma⁷³⁶⁻⁷³⁸ and perineurioma type⁷³⁹ have been described. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor may affect primarily the kidney; the behavior is generally indolent. 753

Vascular tumors and tumorlike conditions of various types rarely arise in the kidney.⁷⁴⁰ Arteriovenous malformations are identical to their soft tissue counterparts.⁷⁴⁰ Hemangioma is frequently located in the medullary portion, where it can give rise to copious hematuria.⁷²⁷ Microscopically, most are of the capillary type, with a sieve-like pattern reminiscent of splenic pulp.⁷⁴⁰ Many exhibit an anastomosing pattern mimicking angiosarcoma (Fig. 24.74). 741 They should be distinguished from RCCs with a prominent angiomatoid component.

Lymphangioma can also involve the kidney, 742,743 but before this diagnosis is made, the more likely possibility of cystic nephroma/MEST should be considered and ruled out. The myopericytoma family of tumors, predominantly glomus tumor (some of them with atypical features)⁷⁴⁴ and the closely related glomangiomyoma, can present as intrarenal masses, raising the differential diagnosis with juxtaglomerular cell tumor.⁷⁴⁵⁻⁷⁴⁷

--- TEXT PROMPT (from Chunk 113) ---
Rewrite the following pathology text into a more formal and comprehensive paragraph suitable for a pathology report. STATEMENT: Sarcomas

Sarcomas of various types can arise in the adult kidney, including the renal capsule. These include leiomyosarcoma (classic or myxoid), synovial sarcoma (increasingly recognized at this site), fibrosarcoma (exceptional), pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma (just as rare), so-called malignant fibrous histiocytoma (pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma, NOS), liposarcoma (but need to rule out renal extension of a retroperitoneal tumor), angiosarcoma, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, malignant mesenchymoma, and clear cell sarcoma (malignant melanoma of soft parts, not to be confused with the pediatric-type renal clear cell sarcoma). Some of the chondrosarcomas have been of the mesenchymal variety. Some of the smooth muscle tumors have occurred in immunosuppressed patients in association with Epstein–Barr virus infection.

The synovial sarcomas, before the possibility of their intrarenal occurrence was realized and documented by molecular studies, were probably included in the heterogeneous group of embryonal sarcomas of the kidney. The reported cases have been of the monophasic type and some had rhabdoid features. It is well to remember that the entrapment of cystically dilated tubules lined by hobnail epithelium can simulate a biphasic appearance (just as the entrapment of bronchoalveolar epithelium can result in a similar appearance in primary or metastatic monophasic synovial sarcoma in the lung).

An important warning is appropriate at this point: Before a diagnosis of primary sarcoma of the kidney of any type is made, the more common possibilities of sarcomatoid RCC (or urothelial carcinoma) and primary retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma (particularly de-differentiated liposarcoma) with secondary renal invasion should be considered.

# Malignant Lymphoma and Related Lymphoid Lesions

Malignant lymphoma of the kidney is usually the expression of generalized disease, but sometimes the kidney is the only site of tumor. Bilaterality is common in either situation. Renal failure may result from diffuse involvement of the organ. The majority of the cases are of large B-cell type. Other types have been described, including low-grade B-cell lymphoma of so-called MALT type (containing lymphoepithelial lesions within renal tubules). Some such cases have been reported in the setting of AIDS and others in organ transplant recipients, sometimes with involvement of the renal allograft.

Two varieties of lymphoma with a predilection for secondary renal involvement are thymic large B-cell lymphoma with sclerosis and lymphomatoid granulomatosis/angiotrophic large cell lymphoma.

Plasmacytomas may be found within the kidney, usually as a result of dissemination in multiple myeloma but sometimes as an expression of extramedullary tumor.

# Metastatic Tumors

Metastatic carcinoma can affect the kidney as a part of a disseminated process, but the renal involvement is only rarely of clinical significance. The metastasis may appear years or decades after the removal of the primary tumor. On CT scan, renal metastases tend to be small, multiple, bilateral, wedge shaped, intracortical, and less exophytic than primary RCC. In contrast to the latter, metastatic tumors are bilateral in a high proportion (over 50%) of cases. About one-third of the patients have microscopic hematuria. Sometimes the metastases are exclusively limited to the renal glomeruli, in an intracapillary or extracapillary fashion, and may be diagnosed by needle biopsy. The most common primary sites are the lung, skin (malignant melanoma), breast, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, ovary, and testis (nonseminomatous germ cell tumors, particularly choriocarcinoma). Examples of odd types of metastatic tumors to the kidney simulating primary renal tumors include adenoid cystic carcinoma of breast and the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma.

# Tumors of Renal Pelvis and Ureter

# Urothelial Carcinoma

Most urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis occur in adults (in whom they constitute about 7% of all primary renal carcinomas). While a history of analgesic abuse and/or coexistence of renal papillary necrosis, Thorotrast exposure for radiographic purposes, or cyclophosphamide therapy may be predisposing factors in a small subset of cases, smoking is likely the greatest risk factor. These tumors have also been reported in horseshoe kidneys; their incidence may actually be increased in this congenital abnormality. Some cases have developed as a manifestation of the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome, and these rare cases may show abnormal expression of mismatch repair proteins by immunohistochemistry. Hematuria is the most common clinical presentation. Synchronous or metachronous tumors elsewhere in the urinary tract (most of them in the bladder) are found in over half of the patients; exceptionally, an independent RCC may be found in the same kidney. Intravenous and retrograde pyelography provides the most accurate means of diagnosis. The sensitivity and accuracy of cytologic examination are higher than for RCC, particularly for the high-grade tumors.

Grossly, these tumors form soft, gray-to-red masses with smooth, glistening surfaces that resemble the urothelial tumors of the bladder. They often diffusely involve the entire renal pelvis and form arborescent masses that may extend down the ureter. Occasionally, they are circumscribed to a calyx or even to the inside of a calyceal cyst. High-grade lesions can spread massively into the renal parenchyma and even reach the renal capsule. They can be distinguished grossly from RCC because of their granular appearance and extensive pelvic involvement.

Urothelial carcinomas of the ureter may be located anywhere along the length of the organ and usually result in dilation of the proximal portion due to lumen obstruction by the tumor. The microscopic appearance of these urothelial carcinomas, whether located in the renal pelvis or ureter, is identical to that of their more common homologues in the bladder. The majority are high-grade neoplasms, the percentage (about 70%) being much higher than for the same tumor type in the bladder. The pelvic neoplasms sometimes extend proximally along the collecting tubules, a pattern that should not be confused with adenocarcinoma. The adjacent urothelium may show urothelial carcinoma in situ. It should be pointed out that upper tract biopsies are fraught with artifacts that can mimic urothelial neoplasia. The similarities with urothelial carcinomas of the bladder also apply to the occurrence of variants such as the micropapillary type and others, as well as their immunohistochemical profile, including coexpression of keratins 7 and 20 and overexpression of p53 protein (particularly in the high-grade tumors). In our experience, up to 25% of upper tract urothelial carcinomas may express nuclear PAX-8.

The standard treatment of pyeloureteral urothelial carcinoma is nephroureterectomy. Segmental resection has sometimes been employed for midureteral lesions, and endoscopic removal has been done for low-grade noninvasive lesions, but the high incidence of multicentricity and coexistent carcinoma in situ.

Figure 24.76 Gross Appearances of Urothelial Carcinoma of Renal Pelvis. A and B, The tumor protrudes into the pelvic cavity and has a granular surface. C, The tumor coats the pelvis and calyces.

The high-grade tumors indicate that radical surgery is the treatment of choice for the large majority of cases. 840,841 Furthermore, these tumors have a tendency to implant along the ureter, especially in its terminal (intramural) portion. Therefore a resection of the bladder cuff may be performed to avoid tumor recurrence. 842,843 The overall 5-year survival rate in the surgically resected cases is about 50%.809,811 The prognosis is largely determined by the stage of the lesion for both the pelvic and ureteral lesions. 844-848 Unfortunately, most of the patients present with locally advanced (pT2 or more) disease at the time of surgery. 828,835

# Other Carcinoma Types

Primary squamous cell carcinoma 813,819,849,850 and primary adenocarcinoma⁸⁵¹⁻⁸⁵⁴ rarely occur in the upper urinary tract. Essentially all rare subtypes and urothelial carcinoma variants described in the urinary bladder may also be identified in the pelvicalyceal and ureteral system, including hepatoid carcinoma,⁸⁵⁵ lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma,⁸⁵⁶ sarcomatoid urothelial carcinoma,835,857-859 giant cell carcinoma,⁸⁶⁰⁻⁸⁶² small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma,618,863 carcinoma with trophoblastic features,⁸⁶⁴⁻⁸⁶⁷ and carcinoma with rhabdoid features.⁸⁶⁸ Verrucous carcinoma has been reported in the pelvis of a horseshoe kidney associated with staghorn calculi. 869 Clinicopathologic features are identical to those described in the urinary bladder.

# Other Tumors and Tumorlike Conditions

Figure 24.77 Benign fibroepithelial polyp emerging from lower calyx of the left kidney in a 61-year-old woman. The tumor caused hematuria, and total nephrectomy was performed.

Fibroepithelial polyp 870,871 (Fig. 24.77) and hypertrophic infundibular stenosis of the calyces⁸⁷² are two rare tumorlike masses of the pelvic region.

Pelvic lipomatosis and fibrolipomatosis result from excessive proliferation of peripelvic fat with or without accompanying fibrous tissue and may simulate a neoplasm radiographically. 873

Amyloidosis can present as a localized nodule in the wall of one or both ureters (so-called amyloid tumor). 874

Myelolipoma morphologically similar to its more common adrenal counterpart can present as a mass in the renal sinus. 875

Malakoplakia of the pelvis or ureter may result in obstruction and hydronephrosis. 876,877

Endometriosis of the ureter presents with hydroureter, often accompanied by hydronephrosis. The disease may be extrinsic to the ureter or present within its wall. As in other sites, endometriosis may rarely be associated with secondary Müllerian neoplasms.

Rewrite the following pathology text into a more formal and comprehensive paragraph suitable for a pathology report. STATEMENT: Most patients have a past history of hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy. The hemangiomas are often located at the tips of the papillae, are multiple in about 10% of the cases, and may result in recurrent episodes of hemorrhage.

Subepithelial hematoma of the renal pelvis (Antopol–Goldman lesion) can present with gross hematuria and radiographically simulate a malignant tumor. The etiology is unknown.

“Urinoma” results from the extravasation of urine into the renal perihilar and peripelvic fat; in the early stages there is lipolysis with foamy macrophages and multinucleated giant cells, followed by fibrosis and deposition of “urinary precipitates.” Demonstration of Tamm–Horsfall protein by immunostaining confirms the fact that the amorphous extracellular precipitates are derived from uroprotein.

Benign pyeloureteral tumors include inverted papilloma (sometimes multiple), nephrogenic adenoma, villous adenoma, hemangioma, leiomyoma, SFT, neurofibroma, granular cell tumor. Malignant tumors of nonepithelial type are exceptional. A few cases of leiomyosarcoma have been reported. Non-Hodgkin malignant lymphoma of the retroperitoneum can involve the ureter secondarily. A case of primary malignant lymphoma has been reported in the pelvis of a transplanted kidney. A few cases of benign and malignant tumors have been reported in ureteroileal conduits.

Metastatic carcinomas to the retroperitoneum can invade the ureteral wall and result in obstruction; the breast and lung are the most common sites for the primary tumors.
