Conjoined kidneys usually connected at the lower pole (Fig. 12.1); most common congenital renal anomaly\n\nB. Kidney is abnormally located in the lower abdomen; horseshoe kidney gets caught on the inferior mesenteric artery root during its ascent from the pelvis to the abdomen.\n\n# II. RENAL AGENESIS\n\nA. Absent kidney formation; may be unilateral or bilateral\n\nB. Unilateral agenesis leads to hypertrophy of the existing kidney; hyperfiltration increases risk of renal failure later in life.\n\nC. Bilateral agenesis leads to oligohydramnios with lung hypoplasia, flat face with low set ears, and developmental defects of the extremities (Potter sequence, Fig. 12.2); incompatible with life\n\n# III. DYSPLASTIC KIDNEY\n\nA. Noninherited, congenital malformation of the renal parenchyma characterized by cysts and abnormal tissue (e.g., cartilage, Fig. 12.3)\n\nB. Usually unilateral; when bilateral, must be distinguished from inherited polycystic kidney disease\n\n# IV. POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE (PKD)\n\nA. Inherited defect leading to bilateral enlarged kidneys with cysts in the renal cortex and medulla (Fig. 12.4)\n\nB. Autosomal recessive form presents in infants as worsening renal failure and hypertension; newborns may present with Potter sequence.\n\n1. Associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis (leads to portal hypertension) and hepatic cysts\n\nC. Autosomal dominant form presents in young adults as hypertension (due to increased renin), hematuria, and worsening renal failure.\n\n1. Due to mutation in the APKD1 or APKD2 gene; cysts develop over time.\n2. Associated with berry aneurysm, hepatic cysts, and mitral valve prolapse\n\n# V. MEDULLARY CYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE\n\nA. Inherited (autosomal dominant) defect leading to cysts in the medullary collecting ducts\n\nB. Parenchymal fibrosis results in shrunken kidneys and worsening renal failure.\n\n# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE (ARF)\n\n# I. BASIC PRINCIPLES\n\nA. Acute, severe decrease in renal function (develops within days)\n\nB. Hallmark is azotemia (increased BUN and creatinine [Cr]), often with oliguria.\n\npathoma.com\n<page_footer>https://t.me/USMLEPathoma</page_footer>\n<page_footer>https://t.me/USMLEPathoma</page_footer>",
    "question": "A newborn presents with oligohydramnios, lung hypoplasia, a flattened face with low-set ears, and developmental defects of the extremities. What is the most likely underlying renal abnormality, and is it compatible with life?",
    "answer": "Bilateral renal agenesis, leading to Potter sequence. It is incompatible with life."

Due to decreased blood flow to kidneys (e.g., cardiac failure); common cause of ARF\n\n# B. Decreased blood flow results in \u2193GFR, azotemia, and oliguria.\n\n# C. Reabsorption of fluid and BUN ensues (serum BUN:Cr ratio > 15); tubular function remains intact (fractional excretion of sodium [FENa] &#x3C; 1% and urine osmolality [osm] > 500 mOsm/kg).\n\n# III. POSTRENAL AZOTEMIA\n\n# A. Due to obstruction of urinary tract downstream from the kidney (e.g., ureters)\n\n# B. Decreased outflow results in \u2193GFR, azotemia, and oliguria.\n\n# C. During early stage of obstruction, increased tubular pressure \"forces\" BUN into the blood (serum BUN:Cr ratio > 15); tubular function remains intact (FENa &#x3C; 1% and urine osm > 500 mOsm/kg).\n\n# D. With long-standing obstruction, tubular damage ensues, resulting in decreased reabsorption of BUN (serum BUN:Cr ratio &#x3C; 15), decreased reabsorption of sodium (FENa > 2%), and inability to concentrate urine (urine osm &#x3C; 500 mOsm/kg).\n\n# IV. ACUTE TUBULAR NECROSIS\n\n# A. Injury and necrosis of tubular epithelial cells (Fig. 12.5); most common cause of acute renal failure (intrarenal azotemia)\n\n# B. Necrotic cells plug tubules; obstruction decreases GFR.\n\n# 1. Brown, granular casts are seen in the urine.\n\n# C. Dysfunctional tubular epithelium results in decreased reabsorption of BUN (serum BUN:Cr ratio &#x3C; 15), decreased reabsorption of sodium (FENa > 2%), and inability to concentrate urine (urine osm &#x3C; 500 mOsm/kg).\n\n# D. Etiology may be ischemic or nephrotoxic.\n\n# 1. Ischemia - Decreased blood supply results in necrosis of tubules.\n\n# i. Often preceded by prerenal azotemia\n\n# ii. Proximal tubule and medullary segment of the thick ascending limb are particularly susceptible to ischemic damage.\n\n# 2. Nephrotoxic - Toxic agents result in necrosis of tubules.\n\n# i. Proximal tubule is particularly susceptible.\n\n# ii. Causes include aminoglycosides (most common), heavy metals (e.g., lead), myoglobinuria (e.g., from crush injury to muscle), ethylene glycol (associated with oxalate crystals in urine), radiocontrast dye, and urate (e.g., tumor lysis syndrome).\n\n# iii. Hydration and allopurinol are used prior to initiation of chemotherapy to decrease risk of urate-induced ATN.\n\n# Figures\n\nFig. 12.1 Horseshoe kidney.

    "question": "How does long-standing postrenal azotemia differ from early postrenal azotemia, and acute tubular necrosis, in terms of serum BUN:Creatinine ratio, fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), and urine osmolality?",
    "answer": "In long-standing postrenal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis, the serum BUN:Creatinine ratio is typically less than 15, FENa is greater than 2%, and urine osmolality is less than 500 mOsm/kg due to tubular damage, whereas in early postrenal azotemia the BUN:Cr ratio is greater than 15, FENa is less than 1%, and urine osmolality is greater than 500 mOsm/kg because tubular function remains largely intact."
