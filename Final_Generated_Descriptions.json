  "Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)": [
    "ccRCC Architecturally, the tumor typically displays a solid, nested, or acinar growth pattern.",
    "ccRCC A delicate, arborizing network of thin-walled blood vessels is characteristically prominent throughout the stroma, separating the nests of tumor cells.",
    "ccRCC The neoplastic cells are generally large and polygonal with abundant, optically clear cytoplasm, a feature resulting from the intracellular accumulation of glycogen and lipids.",
    "ccRCC Nuclear features, which form the basis for the WHO/ISUP grading system, range from small and uniform with inconspicuous nucleoli to large and pleomorphic with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli.",
    "ccRCC Higher-grade tumors may exhibit progression to sarcomatoid or rhabdoid differentiation, the latter characterized by cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei.",
    "ccRCC Alternatively, some tumor cells may display granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, in which case the classic delicate vasculature becomes a critical diagnostic feature."
  ],
  "Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (pRCC)": [
    "pRCC The neoplasm is well-circumscribed by a thick fibrous capsule and demonstrates a predominantly papillary architecture.",
    "pRCC The fibrovascular cores of the papillae are characteristically infiltrated by numerous foamy macrophages.",
    "pRCC A single layer of low cuboidal cells with scanty, pale-staining cytoplasm lines the papillary structures.",
    "pRCC Nuclear features are generally low-grade, though variable, with nucleoli ranging from inconspicuous to eosinophilic at high power magnification.",
    "pRCC Intracytoplasmic hemosiderin deposition is a frequent finding within the neoplastic cells.",
    "pRCC Numerous psammoma bodies are present within both the stroma and the papillary fronds."
  ],
  "Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma (chRCC)": [
    "chRCC Microscopically, the tumor is arranged in broad, solid to alveolar sheets of cells.",
    "chRCC The neoplastic cells are large and polygonal, characterized by abundant pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent, well-defined cell membranes, imparting a \"plant-like\" appearance.",
    "chRCC A distinct, clear perinuclear halo is a characteristic cytoplasmic feature, which can be more conspicuous in the eosinophilic variant of the tumor.",
    "chRCC The nuclei are diagnostically critical, displaying markedly irregular, wrinkled, or \"raisin-like\" nuclear membranes.",
    "chRCC Furthermore, the nuclei consistently demonstrate hyperchromasia and frequent binucleation."
