Kidney and Urinary Tract Pathology

# CONGENITAL

# I. HORSESHOE KIDNEY

A. Conjoined kidneys usually connected at the lower pole (Fig. 12.1); most common congenital renal anomaly

B. Kidney is abnormally located in the lower abdomen; horseshoe kidney gets caught on the inferior mesenteric artery root during its ascent from the pelvis to the abdomen.

# II. RENAL AGENESIS

A. Absent kidney formation; may be unilateral or bilateral

B. Unilateral agenesis leads to hypertrophy of the existing kidney; hyperfiltration increases risk of renal failure later in life.

C. Bilateral agenesis leads to oligohydramnios with lung hypoplasia, flat face with low set ears, and developmental defects of the extremities (Potter sequence, Fig. 12.2); incompatible with life

# III. DYSPLASTIC KIDNEY

A. Noninherited, congenital malformation of the renal parenchyma characterized by cysts and abnormal tissue (e.g., cartilage, Fig. 12.3)

B. Usually unilateral; when bilateral, must be distinguished from inherited polycystic kidney disease

# IV. POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE (PKD)

A. Inherited defect leading to bilateral enlarged kidneys with cysts in the renal cortex and medulla (Fig. 12.4)

B. Autosomal recessive form presents in infants as worsening renal failure and hypertension; newborns may present with Potter sequence.

1. Associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis (leads to portal hypertension) and hepatic cysts

C. Autosomal dominant form presents in young adults as hypertension (due to increased renin), hematuria, and worsening renal failure.

1. Due to mutation in the APKD1 or APKD2 gene; cysts develop over time.
2. Associated with berry aneurysm, hepatic cysts, and mitral valve prolapse

# V. MEDULLARY CYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE

A. Inherited (autosomal dominant) defect leading to cysts in the medullary collecting ducts

B. Parenchymal fibrosis results in shrunken kidneys and worsening renal failure.

# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE (ARF)

# I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Acute, severe decrease in renal function (develops within days)

B. Hallmark is azotemia (increased BUN and creatinine [Cr]), often with oliguria.

# FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

# I. AZOTEMIA

# A. Divided into prerenal, postrenal, and intrarenal azotemia based on etiology

# II. PRERENAL AZOTEMIA

# A. Due to decreased blood flow to kidneys (e.g., cardiac failure); common cause of ARF

# B. Decreased blood flow results in ↓GFR, azotemia, and oliguria.

# C. Reabsorption of fluid and BUN ensues (serum BUN:Cr ratio > 15); tubular function remains intact (fractional excretion of sodium [FENa] &#x3C; 1% and urine osmolality [osm] > 500 mOsm/kg).

# III. POSTRENAL AZOTEMIA

# A. Due to obstruction of urinary tract downstream from the kidney (e.g., ureters)

# B. Decreased outflow results in ↓GFR, azotemia, and oliguria.

# C. During early stage of obstruction, increased tubular pressure "forces" BUN into the blood (serum BUN:Cr ratio > 15); tubular function remains intact (FENa &#x3C; 1% and urine osm > 500 mOsm/kg).

# D. With long-standing obstruction, tubular damage ensues, resulting in decreased reabsorption of BUN (serum BUN:Cr ratio &#x3C; 15), decreased reabsorption of sodium (FENa > 2%), and inability to concentrate urine (urine osm &#x3C; 500 mOsm/kg).

# IV. ACUTE TUBULAR NECROSIS

# A. Injury and necrosis of tubular epithelial cells (Fig. 12.5); most common cause of acute renal failure (intrarenal azotemia)

# B. Necrotic cells plug tubules; obstruction decreases GFR.

# 1. Brown, granular casts are seen in the urine.

# C. Dysfunctional tubular epithelium results in decreased reabsorption of BUN (serum BUN:Cr ratio &#x3C; 15), decreased reabsorption of sodium (FENa > 2%), and inability to concentrate urine (urine osm &#x3C; 500 mOsm/kg).

# D. Etiology may be ischemic or nephrotoxic.

# 1. Ischemia - Decreased blood supply results in necrosis of tubules.

# i. Often preceded by prerenal azotemia

# ii. Proximal tubule and medullary segment of the thick ascending limb are particularly susceptible to ischemic damage.

# 2. Nephrotoxic - Toxic agents result in necrosis of tubules.

# i. Proximal tubule is particularly susceptible.

# ii. Causes include aminoglycosides (most common), heavy metals (e.g., lead), myoglobinuria (e.g., from crush injury to muscle), ethylene glycol (associated with oxalate crystals in urine), radiocontrast dye, and urate (e.g., tumor lysis syndrome).

# iii. Hydration and allopurinol are used prior to initiation of chemotherapy to decrease risk of urate-induced ATN.

# FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

# I. RENAL CELL CARCINOMA

# A.

Presents with classic triad of hematuria, palpable mass, and flank pain

# 1.

All three symptoms rarely occur together; hematuria is the most common symptom.

# 2.

Fever, weight loss, or paraneoplastic syndrome (e.g., EPO, renin, PTHrP, or ACTH) may also be present.

# 3.

Rarely may present with left-sided varicocele

# i.

Involvement of the left renal vein by carcinoma blocks drainage of the left spermatic vein leading to varicocele.

# ii.

Right spermatic vein drains directly into the IVC; hence, right-sided varicocele is not seen.

# B.

Gross exam reveals a yellow mass (Fig. 12.19A); microscopically, the most common variant exhibits clear cytoplasm (clear cell type, Fig. 12.19B).

# C.

Pathogenesis involves loss of VHL (3p) tumor suppressor gene, which leads to increased IGF-1 (promotes growth) and increased HIF transcription factor (increases VEGF and PDGF).

# D.

Tumors may be hereditary or sporadic.

# 1.

Sporadic tumors classically arise in adult males (average age is 60 years) as a single tumor in the upper pole of the kidney; major risk factor for sporadic tumors is cigarette smoke.

# 2.

Hereditary tumors arise in younger adults and are often bilateral.

# i.

Von Hippel-Lindau disease is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with inactivation of the VHL gene leading to increased risk for hemangioblastoma of the cerebellum and renal cell carcinoma.

# E.

Staging

# 1.

T-based on size and involvement of the renal vein (occurs commonly and increases risk of hematogenous spread to the lungs and bone)

# 2.

N- spread to retroperitoneal lymph nodes

# III. WILMS TUMOR

# A.

Malignant kidney tumor comprised of blastema (immature kidney mesenchyme), primitive glomeruli and tubules, and stromal cells (Fig. 12.20)

# 1.

Most common malignant renal tumor in children; average age is 3 years.

# B.

Presents as a large, unilateral flank mass with hematuria and hypertension (due to renin secretion)

# C.

Most cases (90%) are sporadic; syndromic tumors may be seen with

# 1.

WAGR syndrome - Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genital abnormalities, and mental and motor Retardation; associated with deletion of WT1 tumor suppressor gene (located at 11p13)

# 2.

Denys-Drash syndrome - Wilms tumor, progressive renal (glomerular) disease, and male pseudohermaphroditism; associated with mutations of WT1



---


Kidney and Urinary Tract Pathology

# 3. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome

Wilms tumor, neonatal hypoglycemia, muscular hemihypertrophy, and organomegaly (including tongue); associated with mutations in WT2 gene cluster (imprinted genes at 11p15.5), particularly IGF-2

# LOWER URINARY TRACT CARCINOMA

# I. UROTHELIAL (TRANSITIONAL CELL) CARCINOMA

A. Malignant tumor arising from the urothelial lining of the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, or urethra

1. Most common type of lower urinary tract cancer; usually arises in the bladder

B. Major risk factor is cigarette smoke; additional risk factors are naphthylamine, azo dyes, and long-term cyclophosphamide or phenacetin use.

C. Generally seen in older adults; classically presents with painless hematuria

D. Arises via two distinct pathways (Fig. 12.21)

1. Flat - develops as a high-grade flat tumor and then invades; associated with early p53 mutations

2. Papillary - develops as a low-grade papillary tumor that progresses to a high-grade papillary tumor and then invades; not associated with early p53 mutations

E. Tumors are often multifocal and recur ("field defect").

# II. SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of squamous cells, usually involving the bladder

B. Arises in a background of squamous metaplasia (normal bladder surface is not lined by squamous epithelium)

C. Risk factors include chronic cystitis (older woman), Schistosoma haematobium infection (Egyptian male), and long-standing nephrolithiasis.

# III. ADENOCARCINOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of glands, usually involving bladder

B. Arises from a urachal remnant (tumor develops at the dome of the bladder), cystitis glandularis, or exstrophy (congenital failure to form the caudal portion of the anterior abdominal and bladder walls)
